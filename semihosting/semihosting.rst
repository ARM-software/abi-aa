About this document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI specifications:

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

All content in this document is at the **Release** quality level.

Change history

Introduction
============

Semihosting is a mechanism that enables code running on an ARM target or emulator to communicate with and use the Input/Output facilities on a host computer. The host must be running the emulator, or a debugger that is attached to the ARM target.

Examples of these facilities include keyboard input, screen output, and disk I/O. For example, you can use this mechanism to enable functions in the C library, such as ``printf()`` and ``scanf()``, to use the screen and keyboard of the host instead of having a screen and keyboard on the target system.

This is useful because development hardware often does not have all the input and output facilities of the final system. Semihosting enables the host computer to provide these facilities.

Semihosting is implemented by a set of defined software instructions that generate exceptions from program control. The application invokes the appropriate semihosting call and the debug agent then handles the exception. The debug agent provides the required communication with the host.

The semihosting interface is common across all debug agents that are provided by ARM. Semihosted operations work when you are debugging applications on your development platform, as shown in the following figure:

.. figure:: semihosting-overview.svg
   :scale: 75%

In many cases, semihosting is invoked by code within library functions. The application can also invoke the semihosting operation directly.

.. note::

    The instruction that is used to make semihosting calls can be ``SVC``, ``HLT``, or ``BKPT``, depending on the processor. See `The semihosting interface`_ for more detail.

The following terms are used in the semihosting documentation:

Semihosting Implementation
   An agent (for example, a debugger or emulator) that services semihosting operation requests from a Semihosting Caller executing on an ARM target.

Semihosting Caller
   A program executing on an ARM target that sends requests to a Semihosting Implementation (for example, a debugger or emulator) to service semihosting operations.

The semihosting interface
=========================

Semihosting is supported for ARM A and R profiles using the A64, A32, and T32 instruction sets, and for M profile using the T32 instruction set.

Semihosting operations are requested using a trap instruction, which is a software instruction that generates exceptions from program control. Semihosting callers issue trap instructions, and the semihosting implementation then handles the resulting exception to perform the required semihosting operation. The trap instruction can be ``SVC``, ``HLT``, or ``BKPT``, as indicated in the `Semihosting Trap Instructions and Encodings` table:

.. _Semihosting Trap Instructions and Encodings:

.. table:: Semihosting Trap Instructions and Encodings

  +---------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------+
  | Profile       | Instruction Set |   Instruction     |  Opcode        |
  +===============+=================+===================+================+
  | A+R Profile   | A64             | ``HLT #0xF000``   | ``0xD45E0000`` |
  |               +-----------------+-------------------+----------------+
  |               | A32             | ``SVC #0x123456`` | ``0xEF123456`` |
  |               |                 +-------------------+----------------+
  |               |                 | ``HLT #0xF000``   | ``0xE10F0070`` |
  |               +-----------------+-------------------+----------------+
  |               | T32             | ``SVC #0xAB``     | ``0xDFAB``     |
  |               |                 +-------------------+----------------+
  |               |                 | ``HLT #0x3C``     | ``0xBABC``     |
  +---------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------+
  | M--Profile    | T32             | ``BKPT #0xAB``    | ``0xBEAB``     |
  +---------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------+

For A32 and T32 on A+R Profile, semihosting can use either an ``SVC`` or an ``HLT`` trap instruction. Semihosting implementations must support both trap instructions across all versions of the ARM architecture.

.. note::

  This requirement includes supporting the ``HLT`` encodings on ARMv7 and earlier processors, even though ``HLT`` is only defined as an instruction in ARMv8. This may require the semihosting implementation to trap the ``UNDEF`` exception.

The ``HLT`` encodings are new in version 2.0 of the semihosting specification. Where possible, have semihosting callers continue to use the previously existing trap instructions to ensure compatibility with legacy semihosting implementations. These trap instructions are ``HLT`` for A64, ``SVC`` on A+R profile A32 or T32, and ``BKPT`` on M profile. However, it is necessary to change from SVC to HLT instructions to support AArch32 semihosting properly in a mixed AArch32/AArch64 system.

.. note::

  ARM encourages semihosting callers to implement support for trapping using ``HLT`` on A32 and T32 as a configurable option. ARM strongly discourages semihosting callers from mixing the ``HLT`` and ``SVC`` mechanisms within the same executable.

The OPERATION NUMBER REGISTER must contain the number of the semihosting operation to be performed. This number is given in parentheses after the operation name in the following sections. For example, `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_.

Parameters are passed to the operation using the
PARAMETER REGISTER. For most operations, the PARAMETER REGISTER must contain a pointer to a data block that holds the parameters. In some cases a single parameter is passed directly in the PARAMETER REGISTER, or no parameters are passed at all.

Results are returned in the RETURN REGISTER, either as an explicit return value or as a pointer to a data block. If no result is returned, assume that the RETURN REGISTER is corrupted. Some operations also return information in the PARAMETER REGISTER.

Multi-byte values in memory must be formatted as pure little-endian or pure big-endian to match the endianness mapping configuration of the processor.

The `Registers and field size` table shows the specific registers that are used, and the size of the fields in the data block, which depend on whether the caller is 32-bit or 64-bit.

.. _Registers and field size:

.. table:: Registers and field size

  +---------------------------+---------+---------+
  |                           | 32-bit  | 64-bit  |
  +===========================+=========+=========+
  | OPERATION NUMBER REGISTER | ``R0``  | ``W0``  |
  +---------------------------+---------+---------+
  | PARAMETER REGISTER        | ``R1``  | ``X1``  |
  +---------------------------+---------+---------+
  | RETURN REGISTER           | ``R0``  | ``X0``  |
  +---------------------------+---------+---------+
  | Data block field size     | 32 bits | 64 bits |
  +---------------------------+---------+---------+

.. note::

  The operation number is passed in ``W0`` for the 64-bit ABI, which is the bottom 32 bits of the 64-bit register ``X0``. Semihosting implementations must not assume that the top 32 bits of ``X0`` are 0.

A few semihosting operations have other differences between the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. These differences are described in the documentation of those operations.

The available semihosting operation numbers are allocated as follows:

``0x00-0x31``
    Used by ARM.
``0x32-0xFF``
    Reserved for future use by ARM.
``0x100-0x1FF``
    Reserved for user applications. These semihosting operation numbers are not used by ARM. However if you are writing your own ``SVC`` operations, you are advised to use a different ``SVC`` number, rather than using the semihosted ``SVC`` number and these operation type numbers.
``0x200-0xFFFFFFFF``
    Undefined and currently unused. ARM recommends that you do not use these semihosting operation numbers.

.. note::

  Previous versions of the semihosting specification included the operation numbers ``0x17`` (``angel_SWIreason_EnterSVC``) and ``0x19`` (``angelSWI_Reason_SyncCacheRange``). These semihosting operation numbers are now reserved, and are not to be used or implemented.

Semihosting extensions
======================


The semihosting API provides an extension mechanism. Semihosting implementations can provide optional functionality and advertise to the semihosting caller that they do so. Semihosting callers must check that the implementation supports the optional functionality before attempting to use it.

Each extension that the specification defines has an associated feature bit. If the implementation provides the extension, then it reports the feature bit as 1. Each extension definition identifies the feature bit by which feature byte it is in, and which bit within that byte. For example, feature byte 0, bit 3. Feature bytes and bits within them are both numbered starting from 0, with feature bit 0 being the least significant bit. Extensions are independent. Unless otherwise stated, support for one feature does not imply support for any other feature. The caller must check the feature bit for every feature it wants to use.

.. _feature-bits:

Semihosting feature bit reporting sequence format
-------------------------------------------------

Feature bits are reported using a sequence of bytes, which are accessed by using the `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_ call with the special path name ``:semihosting-features``. The byte sequence has the following format:

.. code-block:: none

  byte 0: SHFB_MAGIC_0 0x53
  byte 1: SHFB_MAGIC_1 0x48
  byte 2: SHFB_MAGIC_2 0x46
  byte 3: SHFB_MAGIC_3 0x42
  byte 4: feature byte 0
  byte 5: feature byte 1
  byte 6: feature byte 2
  ...

There is no limit to the number of bytes that can be returned. As future extensions are defined, new bytes will be added. If the read reaches the end of the file before the byte that contains a particular feature bit, then that feature bit must be taken to be 0.

Since the file is a sequence of bytes, the order remains the same whether the processor is big-endian or little-endian. The contents must be treated as a byte array, not an array of words or any other larger type.


Requirements for semihosting implementations
--------------------------------------------

An implementation that implements any semihosting extensions must do the following:

* Handle the special path name ``:semihosting-features`` in `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_ when opened with mode 0 (``r``) or 1 (``rb``). Implement it to return a filehandle that behaves as if it were accessing a file containing a sequence of bytes in the format that is described in `feature-bits`_. Attempts to open this special path name with any other opening mode must fail. The implementation must support opening of this special path name multiple times, both consecutively and simultaneously.

* Support the following operations on the filehandle returned from `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_ of ``:semihosting-features`` :

    `SYS_FLEN (0x0C)`_
          Returns the length of the byte sequence, including the magic number bytes.
    `SYS_ISTTY (0x09)`_
          Always returns 0.
    `SYS_SEEK (0x0A)`_
          Permits random seeks to anywhere within the byte sequence.
    `SYS_READ (0x06)`_
          Reads bytes from the sequence starting from the current seek position.
    `SYS_CLOSE (0x02)`_
          Closes the filehandle.

The special path name does not correspond to a real file in a filesystem, and so no special case handling of it is expected for `SYS_REMOVE (0x0E)`_ or `SYS_RENAME (0x0F)`_.


Requirements for semihosting callers
------------------------------------

To read the feature bits, the semihosting caller must:

1. Call `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_ with the special filename ``:semihosting-features`` and the file opening mode 0 (``r``). If the `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_ fails, then no extensions are supported, so all feature bits should be assumed to be 0.

2. Use the `SYS_READ (0x06)`_ call to read bytes from the filehandle returned by step 1. If the read returns fewer than 5 bytes, or the first 4 bytes are not the correct magic numbers, then no extensions are supported.

  The caller must check all the magic bytes, but can optionally use `SYS_SEEK (0x0A)`_ to seek forwards in the byte sequence to the subsequent byte, or bytes, of interest. Seeking off the end of the file is undefined, so a caller wanting to use `SYS_SEEK (0x0A)`_ must first use `SYS_FLEN (0x0C)`_ to determine the size of the byte sequence.

3.	If the `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_ from step 1 did not fail, the caller must now use `SYS_CLOSE (0x02)`_ to close the filehandle.

It is important to follow this sequence to ensure correct behavior on legacy semihosting implementations, which do not recognize the special filename ``:semihosting-features``.


Example pseudocode function for querying feature bits
-----------------------------------------------------

The following C-like pseudocode describes one possible simple implementation of a check for a specific feature bit:

.. code-block:: none

    #define MAGICLEN 4
    bool sh_feature_supported(int bytenum, int bitnum)
    {
        unsigned char magic[MAGICLEN];
        unsigned char c;
        int fh;
        int len;

        fh = sys_open(":semihosting-features", 0);
        if (fh == -1) {
            return false;
        }
        len = sys_flen(fh);
        if (len <= bytenum) {
            sys_close(fh);
            return false;
        }
        if (sys_read(fh, &magic, MAGICLEN) != 0) {
            sys_close(fh);
            return false;
        }
        if (magic[0] != SHFB_MAGIC_0 ||
            magic[1] != SHFB_MAGIC_1 ||
            magic[2] != SHFB_MAGIC_2 ||
            magic[3] != SHFB_MAGIC_3) {
            sys_close(fh);
            return false;
        }
        if (sys_seek(fh, bytenum) != 0) {
            sys_close(fh);
            return false;
        }
        if (sys_read(fh, &c, 1) != 0) {
            sys_close(fh);
            return false;
        }
        sys_close(fh);
        return (c & (1 << bitnum)) != 0;
    }

More sophisticated implementations can choose to cache the contents of the start of the file with the magic bytes and the first few bytes of feature bit data. Conversely if, for instance, the caller knows in advance that it is only interested in feature bits inside the first feature byte, it can simplify this method to perform a single 5 byte read and need not call `SYS_FLEN (0x0C)`_ or `SYS_SEEK (0x0A)`_.

``SYS_CLOCK (0x10)``
--------------------

Returns the number of centiseconds (hundredths of a second) since the execution started.

Values returned can be of limited use for some benchmarking purposes because of communication overhead or other agent-specific factors. For example, with a debug hardware unit the request is passed back to the host for execution. This can lead to unpredictable delays in transmission and process scheduling.

Use this function to calculate time intervals, by calculating differences between intervals with and without the code sequence to be timed.

Entry
^^^^^

The PARAMETER REGISTER must contain 0. There are no other parameters.

Return
^^^^^^

On exit, the RETURN REGISTER contains:

* The number of centiseconds since some arbitrary start point, if the call is successful.

* –1 if the call is not successful. For example, because of a communications error.

----------------------

Returns the number of elapsed target ticks since execution started.

Use `SYS_TICKFREQ (0x31)`_ to determine the tick frequency.

Entry (32-bit)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On entry, the PARAMETER REGISTER points to a two-field data block to be used for returning the number of elapsed ticks:

**field 1**
    The least significant field and is at the low address.

**field 2**
    The most significant field and is at the high address.

Entry (64-bit)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On entry the PARAMETER REGISTER points to a one-field data block to be used for returning the number of elapsed ticks:

**field 1**
    The number of elapsed ticks as a 64-bit value.

Return
^^^^^^

On exit:

* On success, the RETURN REGISTER contains 0, the PARAMETER REGISTER is unchanged, and the data block pointed to by the PARAMETER REGISTER is filled in with the number of elapsed ticks.

``SYS_EXIT (0x18)``
-------------------

.. note::

  `SYS_EXIT (0x18)`_ was called ``angel_SWIreason_ReportException`` in previous versions of the documentation.

An application calls this operation to report an exception to the debugger directly. The most common use is to report that execution has completed, using ``ADP_Stopped_ApplicationExit``.

.. note::

  This semihosting operation provides no means for 32-bit callers to indicate an application exit with a specified exit code. Semihosting callers may prefer to check for the presence of the `SH_EXT_EXIT_EXTENDED`_ extension and use the `SYS_EXIT_EXTENDED (0x20)`_ operation instead, if it is available.

Entry (32-bit)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On entry, the PARAMETER register is set to a reason code describing the cause of the trap. Not all semihosting client implementations will necessarily trap every corresponding event. These reason codes are defined in the following tables.

The following table shows reason codes relating to hardware exceptions. Exception handlers can use these operations to report an exception that has not been handled:

Entry (64-bit)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On entry, the PARAMETER REGISTER contains a pointer to a two-field argument block:

**field 1**
    The exception type, which is one of the set of reason codes in the above tables.

**field 2**
    A subcode, whose meaning depends on the reason code in field 1.

In particular, if field 1 is ``ADP_Stopped_ApplicationExit`` then field 2 is an exit status code, as passed to the C standard library ``exit()`` function. A simulator receiving this request must notify a connected debugger, if present, and then exit with the specified status.

Return
^^^^^^

No return is expected from these calls. However, it is possible for the debugger to request that the application continues by performing an ``RDI_Execute`` request or equivalent. In this case, execution continues with the registers as they were on entry to the operation, or as subsequently modified by the debugger.

.. raw:: pdf

  PageBreak

``SYS_EXIT_EXTENDED (0x20)``
----------------------------

This operation is only supported if the semihosting extension `SH_EXT_EXIT_EXTENDED`_ is implemented.

.. _SH_EXT_EXIT_EXTENDED:

``SH_EXT_EXIT_EXTENDED`` is reported using feature byte 0, bit 0. If this extension is supported, then the implementation provides a means to report a normal exit with a nonzero exit status in both 32-bit and 64-bit semihosting APIs.

The implementation must provide the semihosting call `SYS_EXIT_EXTENDED (0x20)`_ for both A64 and A32/T32 semihosting APIs.

`SYS_EXIT_EXTENDED (0x20)`_ is used by an application to report an exception or exit to the debugger directly. The most common use is to report that execution has completed, using ``ADP_Stopped_ApplicationExit``.

Entry
^^^^^

On entry, the PARAMETER REGISTER contains a pointer to a two-field argument block:

**field 1**
    The exception type, which should be one of the set of reason codes that are documented for the `SYS_EXIT (0x18)`_ call. For example, ``ADP_Stopped_ApplicationExit`` or ``ADP_Stopped_InternalError``.

**field 2**
    A subcode, whose meaning depends on the reason code in field 1. In particular, if field 1 is ``ADP_Stopped_ApplicationExit`` then field 2 is an exit status code, as passed to the C standard library ``exit()`` function. A simulator receiving this request must notify a connected debugger, if present, and then exit with the specified status.

Return
^^^^^^

No return is expected from these calls.

.. note::

  For the A64 API, this call is identical to the behavior of the mandatory `SYS_EXIT (0x18)`_ call. If this extension is supported, then both calls must be implemented.

**field 1**
    A handle for a previously opened, seekable file object.

Return

``SYS_GET_CMDLINE (0x15)``
--------------------------

Returns the command line that is used for the call to the executable, that is, ``argc`` and ``argv``.

Entry
^^^^^

On entry, the PARAMETER REGISTER points to a two-field data block to be used for returning the command string and its length:

**field 1**
    A pointer to a buffer of at least the size that is specified in field 2.

**field 2**
    The length of the buffer in bytes.

Return
^^^^^^

On exit:

If the call is successful, then the RETURN REGISTER contains 0, the PARAMETER REGISTER is unchanged, and the data block is updated as follows:

**field 1**
    A pointer to a null-terminated string of the command line.

**field 2**
    The length of the string in bytes.

If the call is not successful, then the RETURN REGISTER contains -1.

.. code-block:: none

    struct block {
        void* heap_base;

On entry, the PARAMETER REGISTER contains a pointer to a one-field data block:

**field 1**
    The required status word to check.

Return

On exit, the RETURN REGISTER contains:

* 0 if the status field is not an error indication

* A nonzero value if the status field is an error indication.

  PageBreak

``SYS_OPEN (0x01)``
-------------------

Opens a file on the host system.

The file path is specified either as relative to the current directory of the host process, or absolute, using the path conventions of the host operating system.

Semihosting implementations must support opening the special path name ``:semihosting-features`` as part of the semihosting extensions reporting mechanism. See `Semihosting extensions`_ for details.

ARM targets interpret the special path name ``:tt`` as meaning the console input stream, for an open-read or the console output stream, for an open-write. Opening these streams is performed as part of the standard startup code for those applications that reference the C ``stdio`` streams.

.. _SH_EXT_STDOUT_STDERR:

The semihosting extension ``SH_EXT_STDOUT_STDERR`` allows the semihosting caller to open separate output streams corresponding to ``stdout`` and ``stderr``. This extension is reported using feature byte 0, bit 1. Use `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_ with the special path name ``:semihosting-features`` to access the feature bits. See `Semihosting extensions`_ for details.

If this extension is supported, the implementation must support the following additional semantics to `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_:

* If the special path name ``:tt`` is opened with an ``fopen`` mode requesting write access (``w``, ``wb``, ``w+``, or ``w+b``), then this is a request to open ``stdout``.

*	If the special path name ``:tt`` is opened with a mode requesting append access (``a``, ``ab``, ``a+``, or ``a+b``), then this is a request to open ``stderr``.

Entry
^^^^^

On entry, the PARAMETER REGISTER contains a pointer to a three-field argument block:

**field 1**
    A pointer to a null-terminated string containing a file or device name.

**field 2**
    An integer that specifies the file opening mode. The `Value of mode` table gives the valid values for the integer, and their corresponding ISO C ``fopen()`` mode.

**field 3**
    An integer that gives the length of the string pointed to by field 1.

    The length does not include the terminating null character that must be present.

.. _Value of mode:

``SYS_READ (0x06)``
-------------------

Reads the contents of a file into a buffer.

The file position is specified either:

* Explicitly by a `SYS_SEEK (0x0A)`_.

* Implicitly one byte beyond the previous `SYS_READ (0x06)`_ or `SYS_WRITE (0x05)`_ request.

The file position is at the start of the file when it is opened, and is lost when the file is closed. Perform the file operation as a single action whenever possible. For example, do not split a read of 16KB into four 4KB chunks unless there is no alternative.

Entry
^^^^^

On entry, the PARAMETER REGISTER contains a pointer to a three-field data block:

**field 1**
    Contains a handle for a file previously opened with `SYS_OPEN (0x01)`_.

**field 2**
    Points to a buffer.

**field 3**
    Contains the number of bytes to read to the buffer from the file.

Return
^^^^^^

On exit, the RETURN REGISTER contains the number of bytes not filled in the buffer (``buffer_length - bytes_read``) as follows:

* If the RETURN REGISTER is 0, the entire buffer was successfully filled.

* If the RETURN REGISTER is the same as field 3, no bytes were read (EOF can be assumed).

* If the RETURN REGISTER contains a value smaller than field 3, the read succeeded but the buffer was only partly filled. For interactive devices, this is the most common return value.
