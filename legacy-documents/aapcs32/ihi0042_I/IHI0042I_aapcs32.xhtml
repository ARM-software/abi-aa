<h4>Current Status and Anticipated Changes</h4>
<p>The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI
specifications:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Release</strong></dt>
<dd>Arm considers this specification to have enough
implementations, which have received sufficient testing, to verify
that it is correct. The details of these criteria are dependent on
the scale and complexity of the change over previous versions:
small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but
more complex changes require multiple independent implementations,
which have been rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm
anticipates that future changes to this specification will be
limited to typographical corrections, clarifications and compatible
extensions.</dd>
<dt><strong>Beta</strong></dt>
<dd>Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its
release quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if
issues emerge from its implementation.</dd>
<dt><strong>Alpha</strong></dt>
<dd>The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers
the likelihood of future incompatible changes to be
significant.</dd>
</dl>
<p>All content in this document is at the <strong>Release</strong>
quality level.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>This specification has been developed with the active support of
the following organizations. In alphabetical order: Arm,

<div id="scope">
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The AAPCS defines how subroutines can be separately written,
separately compiled, and separately assembled to work together. It
describes a contract between a calling routine and a called routine
that defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obligations on the caller to create a program state in which
the called routine may start to execute.</li>
<li>Obligations on the called routine to preserve the program state
of the caller across the call.</li>
<li>The rights of the called routine to alter the program state of
its caller.</li>
</ul>
<p>This standard specifies the base for a family of <em>Procedure
Call Standard (PCS)</em> variants generated by choices that reflect
alternative priorities among:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code size.</li>
<li>Performance.</li>
<li>Functionality (for example, ease of debugging, run-time
checking, support for shared libraries).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some aspects of each variant - for example the allowable use of
R9 - are determined by the execution environment. Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible for code complying strictly with the base
standard to be PCS compatible with each of the variants.</li>
<li>It is unusual for code complying with a variant to be
compatible with code complying with any other variant.</li>
<li>Code complying with a variant, or with the base standard, is
not guaranteed to be compatible with an execution environment that
requires those standards. An execution environment may make further
demands beyond the scope of the procedure call standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>This standard is presented in four sections that, after an
introduction, specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>The layout of data.</li>
<li>Layout of the stack and calling between functions with public
interfaces.</li>
<li>Variations available for processor extensions, or when the
execution environment restricts the addressing model.</li>
<li>The C and C++ language bindings for plain data types.</li>
</ul>
<p>This specification does <em>not</em> standardize the
representation of publicly visible C++-language entities that are
not also C language entities (these are described in <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0057/latest">CPPABI</a>)
and it places no requirements on the representation of language
entities that are not visible across public interfaces.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The AAPCS embodies the fifth major revision of the APCS and
third major revision of the TPCS. It forms part of the complete ABI
specification for the Arm Architecture.</p>
<div>
<div id="design-goals">
<h3>Design Goals</h3>
<p>The goals of the AAPCS are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support Thumb-state and Arm-state equally.</li>
<li>Support inter-working between Thumb-state and Arm-state.</li>
<li>Support efficient execution on high-performance implementations
of the Arm Architecture.</li>
<li>Clearly distinguish between mandatory requirements and
implementation discretion.</li>
<li>Minimize the binary incompatibility with the ATPCS.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="conformance">
<h3>Conformance</h3>
<p>The AAPCS defines how separately compiled and separately
assembled routines can work together. There is an <em>externally
visible interface</em> between such routines. It is common that not
all the externally visible interfaces to software are intended to
be <em>publicly visible</em> or open to arbitrary use. In effect,
there is a mismatch between the machine-level concept of external
visibilityâ€”defined rigorously by an object code formatâ€”and a
<em>higher level</em>, application-oriented concept of external
visibilityâ€”which is system-specific or application-specific.</p>
<p>Conformance to the AAPCS requires that<a href="aapcs32.html#aapcs32-f1" id="id2">[1]</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>At all times, stack limits and basic stack alignment are
observed (<a href="aapcs32.html">Universal stack
constraints</a>).</li>
<li>At each call where the control transfer instruction is subject
to a BL-type relocation at static link time, rules on the use of IP
are observed (<a href="aapcs32.html">Use of IP by the
linker</a>).</li>
<li>The routines of each publicly visible interface conform to the
relevant procedure call standard variant.</li>
<li>The data elements<a href="aapcs32.html#aapcs32-f2" id="id3">[2]</a> of each
publicly visible interface conform to the data layout rules.</li>

<div id="half-precision-floating-point">
<h4>Half-precision Floating Point</h4>
<p>Optional extensions to the Arm architecture provide hardware
support for half-precision values. Three formats are currently
supported:</p>
<p>1 - half-precision format specified in IEEE754-2008</p>
<p>2 - Arm Alternative format, which provides additional range but
has no NaNs or Infinities.</p>
<p>3 - Brain floating-point format, which provides a dynamic range
similar to the 32-bit floating-point format, but with less
precision.</p>
<p>The first two formats are mutually exclusive. The base standard
of the AAPCS specifies use of the IEEE754-2008 variant, and a
procedure call variant that uses the Arm Alternative format is
permitted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="containerized-vectors">
<h4>Containerized Vectors</h4>
<p>The content of a containerized vector is opaque to most of the
procedure call standard: the only defined aspect of its layout is
the mapping between the memory format (the way a fundamental type
is stored in memory) and different classes of register at a
procedure call interface. If a language binding defines data types
that map directly onto the containerized vectors it will define how
this mapping is performed.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="endianness-and-byte-ordering">
<h3>Endianness and Byte Ordering</h3>
<p>From a software perspective, memory is an array of bytes, each
of which is addressable.</p>
<p>This ABI supports two views of memory implemented by the
underlying hardware.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a little-endian view of memory the least significant byte of
a data object is at the lowest byte address the data object
occupies in memory.</li>
<li>In a big-endian view of memory the least significant byte of a
data object is at the highest byte address the data object occupies
in memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The least significant bit in an object is always designated as
<em>bit 0</em>.</p>
<p>The mapping of a word-sized data object to memory is shown in
<a href="aapcs32.html">Memory layout of big-endian data object</a>
and <a href="aapcs32.html">Memory layout of little-endian data
object</a>. All objects are pure-endian, so the mappings may be
scaled accordingly for larger or smaller objects <a href="aapcs32.html#aapcs32-f3" id="id4">[3]</a>.</p>

<h3>Composite Types</h3>
<p>A <em>Composite Type</em> is a collection of one or more
Fundamental Data Types that are handled as a single entity at the
procedure call level. A Composite Type can be any of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>aggregate</em>, where the members are laid out
sequentially in memory</li>
<li>A <em>union</em>, where each of the members has the same
address</li>
<li>An <em>array</em>, which is a repeated sequence of some other
type (its base type).</li>
</ul>
<p>The definitions are recursive; that is, each of the types may
contain a Composite Type as a member.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>member alignment</em> of an element of a composite type
is the alignment of that member after the application of any
language alignment modifiers to that member</li>
<li>The <em>natural alignment</em> of a composite type is the
maximum of each of the member alignments of the 'top-level' members
of the composite type i.e. before any alignment adjustment of the
entire composite is applied</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div id="aggregates">
<h4>Aggregates</h4>
<ul>
<li>The alignment of an aggregate shall be the alignment of its
most-aligned component.</li>
<li>The size of an aggregate shall be the smallest multiple of its
alignment that is sufficient to hold all of its members when they
are laid out according to these rules.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="unions">
<h4>Unions</h4>
<ul>
<li>The alignment of a union shall be the alignment of its
most-aligned component.</li>
<li>The size of a union shall be the smallest multiple of its
alignment that is sufficient to hold its largest member.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="arrays">
<h4>Arrays</h4>
<ul>
<li>The alignment of an array shall be the alignment of its base
type.</li>
<li>The size of an array shall be the size of the base type
multiplied by the number of elements in the array.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="bit-fields">
<h4>Bit-fields</h4>
<p>A member of an aggregate that is a Fundamental Data Type may be
subdivided into bit-fields; if there are unused portions of such a
member that are sufficient to start the following member at its
natural alignment then the following member may use the unallocated
portion. For the purposes of calculating the alignment of the
aggregate the type of the member shall be the Fundamental Data Type
upon which the bit-field is based. <a href="aapcs32.html#aapcs32-f4" id="id5">[4]</a> The layout of bit-fields within an aggregate is
defined by the appropriate language binding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="homogeneous-aggregates">
<h4>Homogeneous Aggregates</h4>
<p>A Homogeneous Aggregate is a Composite Type where all of the
Fundamental Data Types that compose the type are the same. The test
for homogeneity is applied after data layout is completed and
without regard to access control or other source language
restrictions.</p>
<p>An aggregate consisting of containerized vector types is treated
as homogeneous if all the members are of the same size, even if the
internal format of the containerized members are different. For
example, a structure containing a vector of 8 bytes and a vector of
4 half-words satisfies the requirements for a homogeneous
aggregate.</p>
<p>A Homogeneous Aggregate has a Base Type, which is the
Fundamental Data Type of each <em>Element</em>. The overall size is
the size of the Base Type multiplied by the number of Elements; its
alignment will be the alignment of the Base Type.</p>

<div id="the-base-procedure-call-standard">
<h2>The Base Procedure Call Standard</h2>
<p>The base standard defines a machine-level, core-registers-only
calling standard common to the Arm and Thumb instruction sets. It
should be used for systems where there is no floating-point
hardware, or where a high degree of inter-working with Thumb code
is required.</p>
<div>
<div id="machine-registers">
<h3>Machine Registers</h3>
<p>The Arm architecture defines a core instruction set plus a
number of additional instructions implemented by co-processors. The
core instruction set can access the core registers and
co-processors can provide additional registers which are available
for specific operations.</p>
<div>
<div id="core-registers">
<h4>Core registers</h4>
<p>There are 16, 32-bit core (integer) registers visible to the Arm
and Thumb instruction sets. These are labeled r0-r15 or R0-R15.
Register names may appear in assembly language in either upper case
or lower case. In this specification upper case is used when the
register has a fixed role in the procedure call standard. <a href="aapcs32.html">Table 2, Core registers and AAPCS usage</a>
summarizes the uses of the core registers in this standard. In
addition to the core registers there is one status register (CPSR)
that is available for use in conforming code.</p>

</table>
<p>The first four registers r0-r3 (a1-a4) are used to pass argument
values into a subroutine and to return a result value from a
function. They may also be used to hold intermediate values within
a routine (but, in general, only <em>between</em> subroutine
calls).</p>
<p>Register r12 (IP) may be used by a linker as a scratch register
between a routine and any subroutine it calls (for details, see
<a href="aapcs32.html">Use of IP by the linker</a>). It
can also be used within a routine to hold intermediate values
between subroutine calls.</p>
<p>In some variants r11 (FP) may be used as a frame pointer in
order to chain frame activation records into a linked list.</p>
<p>The role of register r9 is platform specific. A virtual platform
may assign any role to this register and must document this usage.
For example, it may designate it as the static base (SB) in a
position-independent data model, or it may designate it as the
thread register (TR) in an environment with thread-local storage.
The usage of this register may require that the value held is
persistent across all calls. A virtual platform that has no need
for such a special register may designate r9 as an additional
callee-saved variable register, v6.</p>
<p>Typically, the registers r4-r8, r10 and r11 (v1-v5, v7 and v8)
are used to hold the values of a routine's local variables. Of
these, only v1-v4 can be used uniformly by the whole Thumb
instruction set, but the AAPCS does not require that Thumb code
only use those registers.</p>
<p>A subroutine must preserve the contents of the registers r4-r8,
r10, r11 and SP (and r9 in PCS variants that designate r9 as
v6).</p>
<p>In all variants of the procedure call standard, registers
r12-r15 have special roles. In these roles they are labeled IP, SP,
LR and PC.</p>
<p>The CPSR is a global register with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The N, Z, C, V and Q bits (bits 27-31) and the GE[3:0] bits
(bits 16-19) are undefined on entry to or return from a public
interface. The Q and GE[3:0] bits may only be modified when
executing on a processor where these features are present.</li>
<li>On Arm Architecture 6, the E bit (bit 8) can be used in
applications executing in little-endian mode, or in big-endian-8
mode to temporarily change the endianness of data accesses to
memory. An application must have a designated endianness and at
entry to and return from any public interface the setting of the E
bit must match the designated endianness of the application.</li>
<li>The T bit (bit 5) and the J bit (bit 24) are the execution
state bits. Only instructions designated for modifying these bits
may change them.</li>
<li>The A, I, F and M[4:0] bits (bits 0-7) are the privileged bits
and may only be modified by applications designed to operate

<h5>Handling values larger than 32 bits</h5>
<p>Fundamental types larger than 32 bits may be passed as
parameters to, or returned as the result of, function calls. When
these types are in core registers the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>A double-word sized type is passed in two consecutive registers
(e.g., r0 and r1, or r2 and r3). The content of the registers is as
if the value had been loaded from memory representation with a
single <code>LDM</code> instruction.</li>
<li>A 128-bit containerized vector is passed in four consecutive
registers. The content of the registers is as if the value had been
loaded from memory with a single <code>LDM</code> instruction.</li>

<div id="co-processor-registers">
<h4>Co-processor Registers</h4>
<p>A machine's register set may be extended with additional
registers that are accessed via instructions in the co-processor
instruction space. To the extent that such registers are not used
for passing arguments to and from subroutine calls the use of
co-processor registers is compatible with the base standard. Each
co-processor may provide an additional set of rules that govern the
usage of its registers.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Even though co-processor registers are not used for
passing arguments some elements of the run-time support for a
language may require knowledge of all co-processors in use in an
application in order to function correctly (for example,
<code>setjmp()</code> in C and exceptions in C++).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="vfp-register-usage-conventions">
<h5>VFP register usage conventions</h5>
<p>The VFP-v2 co-processor has 32 single-precision registers,
s0-s31, which may also be accessed as 16 double-precision
registers, d0-d15 (with d0 overlapping s0, s1; d1 overlapping s2,
s3; etc). In addition there are 3 or more system registers,
depending on the implementation. VFP-v3 adds 16 more
double-precision registers d16-d31, but there are no additional
single-precision counterparts. The Advanced SIMD Extension and the
M-profile vector Extension (MVE) use the VFP register set. The
Advanced SIMD Extension uses the double-precision registers for
64-bit vectors and further defines quad-word registers (with q0
overlapping d0, d1; and q1 overlapping d2, d3; etc) for 128-bit
vectors. MVE uses 128-bit vectors in the same quad-word
registers.</p>
<p>Registers s16-s31 (d8-d15, q4-q7) must be preserved across
subroutine calls; registers s0-s15 (d0-d7, q0-q3) do not need to be
preserved (and can be used for passing arguments or returning
results in standard procedure-call variants). Registers d16-d31
(q8-q15), if present, do not need to be preserved.</p>
<p>The FPSCR and VPR registers are the only status registers that
may be accessed by conforming code. FPSCR is a global register with
the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The condition code bits (28-31), the cumulative saturation (QC)
bit (27) and the cumulative exception-status bits (0-4 and 7) are
not preserved across a public interface.</li>
<li>The exception-control bits (8-12 and 15), rounding mode bits
(22-23) and flush-to-zero bits (24) may be modified by calls to
specific support functions that affect the global state of the
application.</li>
<li>The length bits (16-18) must be 0b100 when using M-profile
Vector Extension, 0b000 when using VFP vector mode and otherwise
preserved across a public interface.</li>
<li>The stride bits (20-21) must be zero on entry to and return
from a public interface.</li>
<li>All other bits are reserved and must not be modified. It is not
defined whether the bits read as zero or one, or whether they are
preserved across a public interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>VPR is a global register with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The VPT mask bits (16-23) must be zero on entry to and return
from a public interface.</li>
<li>The predication bits (0-15) are not preserved across a public

<div id="processes-memory-and-the-stack">
<h3>Processes, Memory and the Stack</h3>
<p>The AAPCS applies to a <em>single thread of execution</em> or
<em>process</em> (hereafter referred to as a process). A process
has a <em>program state</em> defined by the underlying machine
registers and the contents of the memory it can access. The memory
a process can access, without causing a run-time fault, may vary
during the execution of the process.</p>
<p>The memory of a process can normally be classified into five
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>code (the program being executed), which must be readable, but
need not be writable, by the process.</li>
<li>read-only static data.</li>
<li>writable static data.</li>
<li>the heap.</li>
<li>the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Writable static data may be further sub-divided into
initialized, zero-initialized and uninitialized data. Except for
the stack there is no requirement for each class of memory to
occupy a single contiguous region of memory. A process must always
have some code and a stack, but need not have any of the other
categories of memory.</p>
<p>The heap is an area (or areas) of memory that are managed by the
process itself (for example, with the C <code>malloc</code>
function). It is typically used for the creation of dynamic data
objects.</p>
<p>A conforming program must only execute instructions that are in
areas of memory designated to contain code.</p>
<div>
<div id="the-stack">
<h4>The Stack</h4>
<p>The stack is a contiguous area of memory that may be used for
storage of local variables and for passing additional arguments to
subroutines when there are insufficient argument registers
available.</p>
<p>The stack implementation is <em>full-descending</em>, with the
current extent of the stack held in the register SP (r13). The
stack will, in general, have both a <em>base</em> and a
<em>limit</em> though in practice an application may not be able to
determine the value of either.</p>
<p>The stack may have a fixed size or be dynamically extendable (by
adjusting the stack-limit downwards).</p>
<p>The rules for maintenance of the stack are divided into two
parts: a set of constraints that must be observed at all times, and
an additional constraint that must be observed at a public
interface.</p>
<div>
<div id="universal-stack-constraints">
<h5>Universal stack constraints</h5>
<p>At all times the following basic constraints must hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack-limit &lt; SP &lt;= stack-base. The stack pointer must
lie within the extent of the stack.</li>
<li>SP mod 4 = 0. The stack must at all times be aligned to a word
boundary.</li>
<li>A process may only store data in the closed interval of the
entire stack delimited by [SP, stack base - 1] (where SP is the
value of register r13).</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This implies that instructions of the following form can fail to
satisfy the stack discipline constraints, even when
<code>reg</code> points within the extent of the stack.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>ldmxx    reg, {..., sp, ...}             // reg != sp
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If execution of the instruction is interrupted
after sp has been loaded, the stack extent will not be restored, so
restarting the instruction might violate the third constraint.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="stack-constraints-at-a-public-interface">
<h5>Stack constraints at a public interface</h5>
<p>The stack must also conform to the following constraint at a
public interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>SP mod 8 = 0. The stack must be double-word aligned.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="stack-probing">
<h5>Stack probing</h5>
<p>In order to ensure stack integrity a process may emit stack
probes immediately prior to allocating additional stack space
(moving SP from SP_old to SP_new). Stack probes must be in the
region of [SP_new, SP_old - 1] and may be either read or write
operations. The minimum interval for stack probing is defined by
the target platform but must be a minimum of 4KBytes. No
recoverable data can be saved below the currently allocated stack
region.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="the-frame-pointer">
<h5>The Frame Pointer</h5>
<p>A platform may require the construction of a list of stack
frames describing the current call hierarchy in a program.</p>
<p>Each frame shall link to the frame of its caller by means of a
Frame Record of two 32-bit values on the stack. The frame record
for the innermost frame (belonging to the most recent routine
invocation) shall be pointed to by the Frame Pointer register (FP).
The lowest addressed word shall point to the previous frame record
and the highest addressed word shall contain the value passed in LR
on entry to the current function. The end of the frame record chain
is indicated by the address zero in the address for the previous
frame. The location of the frame record within a stack frame is not
specified. The frame pointer register must not be updated until the
new frame record has been fully constructed.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>There will always be a short period during
construction or destruction of each frame record during which the
frame pointer will point to the caller's record.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A platform shall mandate the minimum level of conformance with
respect to the maintenance of frame records. The options are, in
decreasing level of functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may require the frame pointer to address a valid frame
record at all times, except that small subroutines which do not
modify the link register may elect not to create a frame
record</li>
<li>It may require the frame pointer to address a valid frame
record at all times, except that any subroutine may elect not to
create a frame record</li>
<li>It may permit the frame pointer register to be used as a
general-purpose callee-saved register, but provide a
platform-specific mechanism for external agents to reliably locate
the chain of frame records</li>
<li>It may elect not to maintain a frame chain and to use the frame
pointer register as a general-purpose callee-saved register.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Unlike the APCS and its variants, the same frame pointer
register is used for both the Arm and Thumb ISAs (including the
Thumb-1 variant), this ensures that the frame chain can be
constructed even when generating code that interworks between both
the Arm and Thumb instruction sets. It is expected that Thumb-1
code will rarely, if ever, want to create stack frames - the choice
of a high register therefore ensures that such code can conform
minimally to the requirements of having a valid value stored in the
frame pointer register without noticably reducing the number of
registers available to normal code.</p>
<p>The AAPCS does not specify where, within a
function's stack frame record, the frame chain data structure
resides. This permits implementors the freedom to use whatever
location will result in the most efficient code needed to establish
the frame chain record. As a result, even in Thumb-1, the overhead
for establishing the frame will rarely exceed three additional
instructions in the function entry sequence and two additional
instructions in the return sequence.</p>

<div>
<div id="subroutine-calls">
<h3>Subroutine Calls</h3>
<p>Both the Arm and Thumb instruction sets contain a primitive
subroutine call instruction, BL, which performs a branch-with-link
operation. The effect of executing BL is to transfer the
sequentially next value of the program counterâ€” the <em>return</em>
address â€”into the link register (LR) and the destination address
into the program counter (PC). Bit 0 of the link register will be
set to 1 if the BL instruction was executed from Thumb state, and
to 0 if executed from Arm state. The result is to transfer control
to the destination address, passing the return address in LR as an
additional parameter to the called subroutine.</p>
<p>Control is returned to the instruction following the BL when the
return address is loaded back into the PC (see <a href="aapcs32.html">Interworking</a>).</p>
<p>A subroutine call can be synthesized by any instruction sequence
that has the effect:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>   LR[31:1] &lt;== return address
   LR[0]    &lt;== code type at return address (0 Arm, 1 Thumb)
   PC       &lt;== subroutine address
   ...
return address:
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For example, in Arm-state, to call a subroutine addressed by r4
with control returning to the following instruction, do</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>MOV  LR, PC
BX   r4
...
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The equivalent sequence will not work from Thumb
state because the instruction that sets LR does not copy the
Thumb-state bit to LR[0].</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Arm Architecture v5 both Arm and Thumb state provide a BLX
instruction that will call a subroutine addressed by a register and
correctly sets the return address to the sequentially next value of
the program counter.</p>
<div>
<div id="use-of-ip-by-the-linker">
<h4>Use of IP by the linker</h4>
<p>Both the Arm- and Thumb-state BL instructions are unable to
address the full 32-bit address space, so it may be necessary for
the linker to insert a veneer between the calling routine and the
called subroutine. Veneers may also be needed to support Arm-Thumb
inter-working or dynamic linking. Any veneer inserted must preserve
the contents of all registers except IP (r12) and the condition
code flags; a conforming program must assume that a veneer that
alters IP may be inserted at any branch instruction that is exposed
to a relocation that supports inter-working or long branches.</p>

<div id="result-return">
<h3>Result Return</h3>
<p>The manner in which a result is returned from a function is
determined by the type of that result.</p>
<p>For the base standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Half-precision Floating Point Type is returned in the least
significant 16 bits of r0.</li>
<li>A Fundamental Data Type that is smaller than 4 bytes is zero-
or sign-extended to a word and returned in r0.</li>
<li>A word-sized Fundamental Data Type (e.g., <code>int</code>,
<code>float</code>) is returned in r0.</li>
<li>A double-word sized Fundamental Data Type (e.g., <code>long
long</code>, <code>double</code> and 64-bit containerized vectors)
is returned in r0 and r1.</li>
<li>A 128-bit containerized vector is returned in r0-r3.</li>
<li>A Composite Type not larger than 4 bytes is returned in r0. The
format is as if the result had been stored in memory at a
word-aligned address and then loaded into r0 with an LDR
instruction. Any bits in r0 that lie outside the bounds of the
result have unspecified values.</li>
<li>A Composite Type larger than 4 bytes, or whose size cannot be
determined statically by both caller and callee, is stored in
memory at an address passed as an extra argument when the function
was called (<a href="aapcs32.html">Parameter Passing</a>,
<a href="aapcs32.html#aapcs32-rulea-4">rule A.4</a>). The memory to be used for
the result may be modified at any point during the function
call.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="parameter-passing">
<h3>Parameter Passing</h3>
<p>The base standard provides for passing arguments in core
registers (r0-r3) and on the stack. For subroutines that take a
small number of parameters, only registers are used, greatly
reducing the overhead of a call.</p>
<p>Parameter passing is defined as a two-level conceptual model</p>
<ul>
<li>A mapping from a source language argument onto a machine
type</li>
<li>The marshalling of machine types to produce the final parameter
list</li>
</ul>
<p>The mapping from the source language onto the machine type is
specific for each language and is described separately (the C and
C++ language bindings are described in <a href="aapcs32.html">Arm C and C++ Language Mappings</a>). The
result is an ordered list of arguments that are to be passed to the
subroutine.</p>
<p>In the following description there are assumed to be a number of
co-processors available for passing and receiving arguments. The
co-processor registers are divided into different classes. An
argument may be a candidate for at most one co-processor register
class. An argument that is suitable for allocation to a
co-processor register is known as a Co-processor Register Candidate
(CPRC).</p>
<p>In the base standard there are no arguments that are candidates
for a co-processor register class.</p>
<p>A variadic function is always marshaled as for the base
standard.</p>
<p>For a caller, sufficient stack space to hold stacked arguments
is assumed to have been allocated prior to marshaling: in practice
the amount of stack space required cannot be known until after the
argument marshalling has been completed. A callee can modify any
stack space used for receiving parameter values from the
caller.</p>
<p>When a Composite Type argument is assigned to core registers
(either fully or partially), the behavior is as if the argument had
been stored to memory at a word-aligned (4-byte) address and then
loaded into consecutive registers using a suitable load-multiple
instruction.</p>

</table>
<p>It should be noted that the above algorithm makes provision for
languages other than C and C++ in that it provides for passing
arrays by value and for passing arguments of dynamic size. The
rules are defined in a way that allows the caller to be always able
to statically determine the amount of stack space that must be
allocated for arguments that are not passed in registers, even if
the function is variadic.</p>
<p>Several further observations can also be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial stack slot address is the value of the stack
pointer that will be passed to the subroutine. It may therefore be
necessary to run through the above algorithm twice during
compilation, once to determine the amount of stack space required
for arguments and a second time to assign final stack slot
addresses.</li>
<li>A double-word aligned type will always start in an
even-numbered core register, or at a double-word aligned address on
the stack even if it is not the first member of an aggregate.</li>
<li>Arguments are allocated first to registers and only excess
arguments are placed on the stack.</li>
<li>Arguments that are Fundamental Data Types can either be
entirely in registers or entirely on the stack.</li>
<li>At most one argument can be split between registers and memory
according to <a href="aapcs32.html#aapcs32-rulec-5">rule C.5</a>.</li>
<li>CPRCs may be allocated to co-processor registers or the stack -
they may never be allocated to core registers.</li>
<li>Since an argument may be a candidate for at most one class of
co-processor register, then the rules for multiple co-processors
(should they be present) may be applied in any order without
affecting the behavior.</li>
<li>An argument may only be split between core registers and the
stack if all preceding CPRCs have been allocated to co-processor
registers.</li>

<p>Calls to functions that use <code>bl&lt;cond&gt;</code>,
<code>b</code>, or <code>b&lt;cond&gt;</code> will need a
linker-generated veneer if a state change is required, so it may
sometimes be more efficient to use a sequence that permits use of
an unconditional <code>bl</code> instruction.</p>
<p>Return sequences may use load-multiple operations that directly
load the PC or a suitable <code>bx</code> instruction.</p>
<p>The following traditional return must not be used if
inter-working might be required.</p>

<p>Arm v4T</p>
<p>In addition to the constraints for Arm v5, the following
additional restrictions apply to Arm v4T.</p>
<p>Calls using <code>bl</code> that involve a state change also
require a linker-generated stub.</p>
<p>Calls via function pointers must use a sequence equivalent to
the Arm-state code</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>mov   lr, pc
bx    Rm
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, this sequence does not work for Thumb state, so usually
a <code>bl</code> to a veneer that does the <code>bx</code>
instruction must be used.</p>
<p>Return sequences must restore any saved registers and then use a
<code>bx</code> instruction to return to the caller.</p>
<p>Arm v4</p>
<p>The Arm v4 Architecture supports neither Thumb state nor the
<code>bx</code> instruction, therefore it is not strictly
compatible with the AAPCS.</p>
<p>It is recommended that code for Arm v4 be compiled using Arm v4T
inter-working sequences but with all <code>bx</code> instructions
subject to relocation by an <code>R_ARM_V4BX</code> relocation
[<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0044/latest">AAELF</a>].
A linker linking for Arm V4 can then change all instances of:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>bx    Rm
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Into:</p>

<h4>Enumerated Types</h4>
<p>This ABI delegates a choice of representation of enumerated
types to a platform ABI (whether defined by a standard or by custom
and practice) or to an interface contract if there is no defined
platform ABI.</p>
<p>The two permitted ABI variants are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An enumerated type normally occupies a word (<code>int</code>
or <code>unsigned int</code>). If a word cannot represent all of
its enumerated values the type occupies a double word (<code>long
long</code> or <code>unsigned long long</code>).</li>
<li>The type of the storage container for an enumerated type is the
smallest integer type that can contain all of its enumerated
values.</li>
</ul>
<p>When both the signed and unsigned versions of an integer type
can represent all values, this ABI recommends that the unsigned
type should be preferred (in line with common practice).</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>The definition of enumerated types in the C and C++ language
standards does not define a binary interface and leaves open the
following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the container for an enumerated type have a fixed size (as
expected in most OS environments) or is the size no larger than
needed to hold the values of the enumeration (as expected by most
embedded users)?</li>
<li>What happens when a (strictly, non-conforming) enumerated value
(e.g. MAXINT+1) overflows a fixed-size (e.g. <code>int</code>)
container?</li>
<li>Is a value of enumerated type (after any conversion required by
C/C++) signed or unsigned?</li>
</ul>
<p>In relation to the last question the C and C++ language
standards state:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[C]</strong> Each enumerated type shall be compatible
with an integer type. The choice of type is implementation-defined,
but <em>shall be capable of representing the values of all the
members of the enumeration</em>.</li>
<li><strong>[C++]</strong> An enumerated type is
<strong>not</strong> an integral type but ... An rvalue of...
enumeration type (7.2) can be converted to an rvalue of the first
of the following types that can represent all the values of its
underlying type: <code>int</code>, <code>unsigned int</code>,
<code>long</code>, or <code>unsigned long</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this ABI, these statements allow a header file that
describes the interface to a portable binary package to force its
clients, in a portable, strictly-conforming manner, to adopt a
32-bit signed (<code>int</code>/<code>long</code>) representation
of values of enumerated type (by defining a negative enumerator, a
positive one, and ensuring the range of enumerators spans more than
16 bits but not more than 32).</p>
<p>Otherwise, a common interpretation of the binary representation
must be established by appealing to a platform ABI or a separate
interface contract.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="additional-types">
<h4>Additional Types</h4>
<p>Both C and C++ require that a system provide additional type
definitions that are defined in terms of the base types. Normally
these types are defined by inclusion of the appropriate header
file. However, in C++ the underlying type of <code>size_t</code>
can be exposed without the use of any header files simply by using
<code>::operator new()</code>, and the definition of
<code>va_list</code> has implications for the internal
implementation in the compiler. An AAPCS conforming object must use
the definitions shown in <a href="aapcs32.html">Table 5,
Additional data types</a>.</p>

<div id="volatile-data-types">
<h4>Volatile Data Types</h4>
<p>A data type declaration may be qualified with the
<code>volatile</code> type qualifier. The compiler may not remove
any access to a volatile data type unless it can prove that the
code containing the access will never be executed; however, a
compiler may ignore a volatile qualification of an automatic
variable whose address is never taken unless the function calls
<code>setjmp()</code>. A volatile qualification on a structure or
union shall be interpreted as applying the qualification
recursively to each of the fundamental data types of which it is
composed. Access to a volatile-qualified fundamental data type must
always be made by accessing the whole type.</p>
<p>The behavior of assigning to or from an entire structure or
union that contains volatile-qualified members is undefined.
Likewise, the behavior is undefined if a cast is used to change
either the qualification or the size of the type.</p>
<p>Not all Arm architectures provide for access to types of all
widths; for example, prior to Arm Architecture 4 there were no
instructions to access a 16-bit quantity, and similar issues apply
to accessing 64-bit quantities. Further, the memory system
underlying the processor may have a restricted bus width to some or
all of memory. The only guarantee applying to volatile types in
these circumstances are that each byte of the type shall be
accessed exactly once for each access mandated above, and that any
bytes containing volatile data that lie outside the type shall not
be accessed. Nevertheless, if the compiler has an instruction
available that will access the type exactly it should use it in
preference to smaller or larger accesses.</p>

<h4>Structure, Union and Class Layout</h4>

<h4>Bit-fields</h4>
<p>A bit-field may have any integral type (including enumerated and
bool types).</p>
<p>A sequence of bit-fields is laid out in the order declared using
the rules below.</p>
<p>For each bit-field, the type of its container is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its declared type if its size is no larger than the size of its
declared type.</li>
<li>The largest integral type no larger than its size if its size
is larger than the size of its declared type (see <a href="aapcs32.html">Over-sized bit-fields</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The container type contributes to the alignment of the
containing aggregate in the same way a plain (not bit-field) member
of that type would, without exception for zero-sized or anonymous
bit-fields.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The C++ standard states that an anonymous bit-field
is not a member, so it is unclear whether or not an anonymous
bit-field of non-zero size should contribute to an aggregate's
alignment. Under this ABI it does.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The content of each bit-field is contained by exactly one
instance of its container type.</p>
<p>Initially, we define the layout of fields that are no bigger
than their container types.</p>

<div>
<pre>CA(F) = &amp;(container(F));

</pre></div>
</div>

</div>
<p>The bit-offset of <code>F</code> within the container,
<code>K(F)</code>, is defined in an endian-dependent manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>For big-endian data types <code>K(F)</code> is the offset from
the most significant bit of the container to the most significant
bit of the bit-field.</li>
<li>For little-endian data types <code>K(F)</code> is the offset
from the least significant bit of the container to the least
significant bit of the bit-field.</li>
</ul>
<p>A bit-field can be extracted by loading its container, shifting
and masking by amounts that depend on the byte order,
<code>K(F)</code>, the container size, and the field width, then

<p>That is, the largest integral multiple of <code>Y</code> that is

(<code>NCBA</code>) which will be used when there is insufficient
space in the current container to hold the next bit-field as</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>NCBA(BA, A) = TRUNCATE(BA + A - 1, A)
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At each stage in the laying out of a sequence of bit-fields
there is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A current bit address (<code>CBA</code>)</li>
<li>A container size, <code>C</code>, and alignment,
<code>A</code>, determined by the type of the field about to be
laid out (8, 16, 32, ...)</li>
<li>A field width, <code>W</code> (<img class="documents-docsimg-inline" src="671cf21691fd6f03157bda736f8d4910c1261519.png" alt="\le"/>
<code>C</code>).</li>

<li>Assign <code>BA(F) = CBA</code></li>
<li>Set <code>CBA = CBA + W</code>.</li>

<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The AAPCS does not allow exported interfaces to
contain packed structures or bit-fields. However a scheme for
laying out packed bit-fields can be achieved by reducing the
alignment, <code>A</code>, in the above rules to below that of the
natural container type. ARMCC uses an alignment of <code>A=8</code>
in these cases, but GCC uses an alignment of <code>A=1</code>.</p>

<div id="bit-field-extraction-expressions">
<h5>Bit-field extraction expressions</h5>
<p>To access a field, <code>F</code>, of width <code>W</code> and
container width <code>C</code> at the bit-address
<code>BA(F)</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the (naturally aligned) container at byte address
<code>TRUNCATE(BA(F), C) / 8</code> into a register <code>R</code>
(or two registers if the container is 64-bits)</li>
<li>Set <code>Q = MAX(32, C)</code></li>
<li>Little-endian, set <code>R = (R &lt;&lt; ((Q - W) - (BA MOD

<li>Big-endian, set <code>R = (R &lt;&lt; (BA MOD C)) &gt;&gt; (Q -
W)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The long long bit-fields use shifting operations on 64-bit
quantities; it may often be the case that these expressions can be
simplified to use operations on a single 32-bit quantity (but see

number and width of container accesses</a>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="over-sized-bit-fields">
<h5>Over-sized bit-fields</h5>
<p>C++ permits the width specification of a bit-field to exceed the
container size and the rules for allocation are given in [<a href="http://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html">GCPPABI</a>].
Using the notation described above, the allocation of an over-sized
bit-field of width <code>W</code>, for a container of width
<code>C</code> and alignment <code>A</code> is achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a new container width <code>C'</code> which is the
width of the fundamental integer data type with the largest size
less than or equal to <code>W</code>. The alignment of this
container will be <code>A'</code>. Note that <code>C' &gt;=
C</code> and <code>A' &gt;= A</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>C' &gt; UCB(CBA, C', A')</code> setting <code>CBA =
NCBA(CBA, A')</code>. This ensures that the bit-field will be
placed at the start of the next container type.</li>
<li>Allocating a normal (undersized) bit-field using the values
(<code>C</code>, <code>C'</code>, <code>A'</code>) for
(<code>W</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>A</code>).</li>
<li>Setting <code>CBA = CBA + W - C</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Although standard C++ does not have a <code>long
long</code> data type, this is a common extension to the language.
To avoid the presence of this type changing the layout of oversized
bit-fields the above rules are described in terms of the
fundamental machine types (<a href="aapcs32.html">Fundamental Data Types</a>) where a 64-bit
integer data type always exists.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An oversized bit-field can be accessed simply by accessing its
container type.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="combining-bit-field-and-non-bit-field-members">
<h5>Combining bit-field and non-bit-field members</h5>
<p>A bit-field container may overlap a non-bit-field member. For
the purposes of determining the layout of bit-field members the
<code>CBA</code> will be the address of the first unallocated bit
after the preceding non-bit-field type.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Any tail-padding added to a structure that
immediately precedes a bit-field member is part of the structure
and must be taken into account when determining the
<code>CBA</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When a non-bit-field member follows a bit-field it is placed at
the lowest acceptable address following the allocated
bit-field.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>When laying out fundamental data types it is
possible to consider them all to be bit-fields with a width equal
to the container size. The rules in <a href="aapcs32.html">Bit-fields no larger than their
container</a> can then be applied to determine the precise address
within a structure.</p>

<div>
<div id="volatile-bit-fields-preserving-number-and-width-of-container-accesses">
<h5>Volatile bit-fields - preserving number and width of container
accesses</h5>
<p>When a volatile bit-field is read, and its container does not
overlap with any non-bit-field member, its container must be read
exactly once using the access width appropriate to the type of the
container.</p>
<p>When a volatile bit-field is written, and its container does not
overlap with any non-bit-field member, its container must be read
exactly once and written exactly once using the access width
appropriate to the type of the container. The two accesses are not
atomic.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This ABI does not place any restrictions on the
access widths of bit-fields where the container overlaps with a
non-bit-field member. This is because the C/C++ memory model
defines these as being separate memory locations, which can be
accessed by two threads simultaneously. For this reason, compilers
must be permitted to use a narrower memory access width (including
splitting the access into multiple instructions) to avoid writing
to a different memory location. For example, in <code>struct S {
int a:24; char b; };</code> a write to <code>a</code> must not also
write to the location occupied by <code>b</code>, this requires at
least two memory accesses in all current Arm architectures.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Multiple accesses to the same volatile bit-field, or to
additional volatile bit-fields within the same container may not be
merged. For example, an increment of a volatile bit-field must
always be implemented as two reads and a write.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Note the volatile access rules apply even when the
width and alignment of the bit-field imply that the access could be
achieved more efficiently using a narrower type. For a write
operation the read must always occur even if the entire contents of
the container will be replaced.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If the containers of two volatile bit-fields overlap then access
to one bit-field will cause an access to the other. For example, in
<code>struct S {volatile int a:8; volatile char b:2};</code> an
access to <code>a</code> will also cause an access to
<code>b</code>, but not vice-versa.</p>
<p>If the container of a non-volatile bit-field overlaps a volatile
bit-field then it is undefined whether access to the non-volatile
field will cause the volatile field to be accessed.</p>

<div id="argument-passing-conventions">
<h3>Argument Passing Conventions</h3>
<p>The argument list for a subroutine call is formed by taking the
user arguments in the order in which they are specified.</p>
<ul>
<li>For C, each argument is formed from the value specified in the
source code, except that an array is passed by passing the address
of its first element.</li>
<li>For C++, an implicit <code>this</code> parameter is passed as
an extra argument that immediately precedes the first user
argument. Other rules for marshalling C++ arguments are described
in <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0057/latest">CPPABI</a>.</li>
<li>For variadic functions, <code>float</code> arguments that match
the ellipsis (...) are converted to type <code>double</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument list is then processed according to the standard
rules for procedure calls (see <a href="aapcs32.html">Parameter Passing</a>) or the appropriate

<h2>APPENDIX Support for Advanced SIMD Extensions and MVE</h2>
<div>
<div id="aapcs32-appendixa-1">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Advanced SIMD and M-profile Vector Extension to the Arm
architecture add support for processing short vectors. Because the
C and C++ languages do not provide standard types to represent
these vectors, access to them is provided by a vendor extension.
The status of this appendix is normative in respect of public
binary interfaces, i.e. the calling convention and name mangling of
functions which use these types. In other respects it is
informative.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="simd-vector-data-types">
<h3>SIMD vector data types</h3>
<p>Access to the SIMD vector data types is obtained by including
either of the two following header files: <code>arm_neon.h</code>,
<code>arm_mve.h</code>. These headers provide the following
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>They provide a set of user-level type names that map onto short
vector types</li>
<li>They provide prototypes for intrinsic functions that map onto
the Advanced SIMD and M-profile Vector Extension(MVE) intruction
sets respectively.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The intrinsic functions are beyond the scope of
this specification. Details of the usage of the user-level types
(e.g. initialization, and automatic conversions) are also beyond
the scope of this specification. For further details see [<a href="https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers/arm-compiler-5/docs/101028/latest/1-preface">ACLE</a>].</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The user-level types are listed in <a href="aapcs32.html">Table 6: Advanced SIMD Extension only vector data
types using 64-bit containerized vectors</a> and <a href="aapcs32.html">Table 7: SIMD vector data types using 128-bit
containerized vectors</a>. The types have 64-bit alignment and map
directly onto the containerized vector fundamental data types. The
memory format of the containerized vector is defined as loading the
specified registers from an array of the Base Type using the Fill
Operation and then storing that value to memory using a single
<code>VSTM</code> of the loaded 64-bit (D) registers.</p>
<p>MVE only allows 128-bit vector types and it uses unsigned
integer vectors to represent polynomials.</p>
<p>The tables also list equivalent structure types to
be used for name mangling. Whether these types are actually defined
by an implementation is unspecified.</p>

interface such as using additional argument registers or passing
