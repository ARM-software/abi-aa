Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You
under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the Licence_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

Contributions
-------------

Contributions to this project are licensed under an inbound=outbound
model such that any such contributions are licensed by the contributor
under the same terms as those in the `Licence`_ section.

About this document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI specifications:

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

This document is a draft and all content is at the **Alpha** quality level.

Change history
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is no entry in the change history table for a release, there are no
changes to the content of the document for that release.

**Notes**

.. _Note 1:

1. The architecture defines the following register overlaps:

   * General registers (X registers) overlap with the capability registers (C
     registers). A given X register is mapped to the low 64 bits of the
     corresponding C register.

   * Stack pointer (register SP) overlaps with the capability stack pointer
     (register CSP). Register SP is mapped to the low 64 bits of the CSP
     register.

   * Program counter (register PC) overlaps with the program counter capability
     (register PCC).  Register PC is mapped to the low 64 bits of the PCC
     register.

   The DWARF call frame instructions do not explicitly specify the size of a
   register. This is implicit in the definition of the register. As a
   consequence, the overlapping registers have been allocated separate DWARF
   register number ranges which have their own definition for the size of these
   registers.

   When searching the call frame information table for one of these registers a
   consumer must take into account the aliasing between them and their
   overlapping registers.

.. TODO Add a section that describes how to handle the aliasing and
   reference it from this note.

.. _Note 2:

2. Capability registers are stored in memory including their tag bit. When
   debug information describes that a capability register is saved at some
   address, a consumer must use a proper load of a capability from memory to
   restore its value.

   Capabilities are always stored in the little-endian byte order. This implies
   that if a given capability register C is stored in memory on a big-endian
   system, its corresponding X part is not stored in the natural byte order but
   as little-endian too.

Canonical frame address
-----------------------

The term Canonical Frame Address (CFA) is defined in GDWARF_, §6.4, Call Frame
Information. This ABI adopts the typical definition of CFA given there.

* The CFA is the value of the stack pointer at the call site in the previous
  frame.

A subroutine can define the CFA as either a 64-bit address or a 129-bit
capability depending on whether the subroutine uses register SP as the stack
pointer or register CSP, respectively.

The AAPCS64 document (AAPCS64_, §5.2.2 Stack) describes what
stack pointer is used by subroutines conforming to AAPCS64 and AAPCS64-cap:

* A subroutine conforming to AAPCS64 uses register SP as the stack pointer. The
  CFA in the subroutine is then defined as a 64-bit address, typically as
  ``SP+<offset>`` or ``X29+<offset>``.

* A subroutine conforming to AAPCS64-cap uses register CSP as the stack pointer.
  The CFA in the subroutine is defined as a 129-bit capability, typically as
  ``CSP+<offset>`` or ``C29+<offset>``.

If a subroutine defines the CFA as a 64-bit address, then only the lowest 64 bits
from the value stored in register CSP in the previous frame can be restored. The
consumer should treat the remaining bits as undefined.

Common information entries
--------------------------

Augmentation characters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This specification adds one CIE augmentation character that might appear as part
of a CIE augmentation string:

* The 'C' character indicates that the default unwind rules for this CIE should
  be initialized in accordance with the pure capability procedure call standard.

Return address register
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A subroutine can return to either a 64-bit address or a 129-bit capability
depending on whether the subroutine expects the return address to be stored in
register LR or CLR, respectively.

The AAPCS64 document (AAPCS64_, §5.6 Function returns and the
link register) describes where the return address for subroutines conforming to
AAPCS64 and AAPCS64-cap is stored:

* A subroutine conforming to AAPCS64 expects the return address to be stored in
  register LR. The ``return_address_register`` field in the CIE is then set to a
  column for a 64-bit register, typically to the LR column directly.

* A subroutine conforming to AAPCS64-cap expects the return address to be stored
  in register CLR. The ``return_address_register`` field in the CIE is set to a
  column for a 129-bit capability register, typically to the CLR column.

If a subroutine uses a 64-bit return address register then it must also
guarantee that it does not modify the upper 65 bits of register PCC. The value
of PCC in the previous frame can then be restored by a consumer by using the PCC
from the current frame and replacing the lowest 64 bits by the calculated value
of the return address register in the previous frame.

.. TODO Call frame instructions: Describe that DW_CFA_def_cfa and friends can be
   used with Cn, and how they equal to the new DWARF expressions.

.. TODO Dwarf expression operations: Add capability sub-operations (after they
   get prototyped in LLVM/GCC).

DWARF attributes
----------------

Address classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GDWARF_, §5.3, Type Modifier Entries, describes attribute
``DW_AT_address_class`` that denotes how objects having the given pointer or
reference type ought to be dereferenced. Section §2.12, Segmented Addresses then
describes that the set of permissible values is specific to each target
architecture.

This ABI uses the common address class value ``DW_ADDR_none`` and defines one
Morello-specific value ``DW_ADDR_capability``.

.. table:: Morello DWARF address class codes

   +------------------------+-------+
   | Address class name     | Value |
   +========================+=======+
   | ``DW_ADDR_none``       | 0x0   |
   +------------------------+-------+
   | ``DW_ADDR_capability`` | 0x1   |
   +------------------------+-------+

1. ``DW_ADDR_none``

   The ``DW_ADDR_none`` value is defined in GDWARF_, §2.12, Segmented Addresses
   and means that no address class has been specified.

2. ``DW_ADDR_capability``

   The ``DW_ADDR_capability`` value indicates that the type is an address
   capability and can be dereferenced as such.

Base type encodings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GDWARF_, §5.1, Base Type Entries, describes attribute ``DW_AT_encoding`` that
denotes how a base type is encoded and is to be interpreted.

This ABI uses two vendor-defined base-type encodings
``DW_ATE_CHERI_signed_intcap`` and ``DW_ATE_CHERI_unsigned_intcap``.

.. table:: Morello DWARF base type encoding values

   +----------------------------------+-------+
   | Base type encoding name          | Value |
   +==================================+=======+
   | ``DW_ATE_CHERI_signed_intcap``   | 0xa0  |
   +----------------------------------+-------+
   | ``DW_ATE_CHERI_unsigned_intcap`` | 0xa1  |
   +----------------------------------+-------+

1. ``DW_ATE_CHERI_signed_intcap``

   The ``DW_ATE_CHERI_signed_intcap`` encoding describes a signed
   integer/capability type ``__intcap_t``.

2. ``DW_ATE_CHERI_unsigned_intcap``

   The ``DW_ATE_CHERI_unsigned_intcap`` encoding describes an unsigned
   integer/capability type ``__uintcap_t``.

Size attributes for capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A size attribute of an entry that describes a capability type should record the
untagged memory size of the data object. This typically means that such an entry
should have the ``DW_AT_byte_size`` attribute with value set to 16.

Given that the formal size of a capability is 16 bytes, consumers of DWARF will
have to implement ways to read the additional tag bit when required. This is
implementation specific.

*When inspecting capabilities, a debugger might choose to display only the
untagged, 16-byte value, and provide the possibility for the user to further
query the tag only if interested. In such a case, the value and the tag can be
read independently of each other.  Alternatively, it is perfectly valid for an
implementation to always read and display the full 129 bits of the capability.*

Capability type examples
------------------------

Capability pointers and references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The capability pointer type in example fragment `Capability pointer\: C++
source`_ can be described in DWARF as shown in `Capability pointer\: DWARF
description`_.

.. _Capability pointer\: C++ source:

.. class:: code-heading

Capability pointer: C++ source

.. code-block:: c

   char * __capability cap;

.. _Capability pointer\: DWARF description:

.. class:: code-heading

Capability pointer: DWARF description

.. code-block:: none

   1$: DW_TAG_base_type
           DW_AT_name("char")
           ...
   2$: DW_TAG_pointer_type
           DW_AT_type(reference to 1$)
           DW_AT_address_class(DW_ADDR_capability)
           DW_AT_byte_size(16)

Capability reference and rvalue reference types can be represented in the same
way using ``DW_TAG_reference_type`` and ``DW_TAG_rvalue_reference_type``,
respectively.

Types ``__intcap_t`` and ``__uintcap_t``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``__intcap_t`` and ``__uintcap_t`` types in example fragment
`Intcap types\: C++ source`_ can be described in DWARF as illustrated in
`Intcap types\: DWARF description`_.

.. _Intcap types\: C++ source:

.. class:: code-heading

Intcap types: C++ source

.. code-block:: c

   __intcap_t intcap;
   __uintcap_t uintcap;

.. _Intcap types\: DWARF description:

           DW_AT_byte_size(16)
   2$: DW_TAG_base_type
           DW_AT_name("__uintcap_t")
           DW_AT_encoding(DW_ATE_CHERI_unsigned_intcap)
           DW_AT_byte_size(16)

Optimized description in DWARF Version 5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additional attributes needed to describe capability types can have recognizable
impact on the size of debugging information in programs that extensively use
capability pointers and references.

DWARF Version 5 introduced the new operand form ``DW_FORM_implicit_const``
(GDWARF5_, §7.5.3, Abbreviations Tables) which allows to extract common
attributes of capability types in section ``.debug_abbrev`` instead of repeating
them in ``.debug_info``.

Two capability pointer types in example fragment `Capability pointers\: C++
source`_ can be described in DWARF Version 5 as illustrated in `Capability
pointers\: DWARF Version 5 description`_.

.. _Capability pointers\: C++ source:

.. class:: code-heading

Capability pointers: C++ source

.. code-block:: c

   char * __capability ccap;
   int * __capability icap;

CFI assembler syntax for pure capability functions
--------------------------------------------------

It is recommended for a toolchain vendor to introduce assembler syntax that
allows the description of call frame information for subroutines that conform to
AAPCS64-cap as easily as for the ones conforming to AAPCS64.

For instance, listing `GNU assembler syntax for pure capability functions`_
shows the extension that was introduced to the GNU assembler syntax:

.. _GNU assembler syntax for pure capability functions:

.. class:: code-heading

GNU assembler syntax for pure capability functions

.. code-block:: asm

   .cfi_startproc purecap

Using the ``purecap`` parameter causes ``.cfi_startproc`` to do the following:

* Initial CFI instructions consist of one instruction ``DW_CFA_def_cfa CSP, 0``.

* Return address register is set to CLR.

* The 'C' character is included in the CIE augmentation string.

.. TODO Add examples that show how unwinding works in various cases. Use
   test cases from lldb/test/testcases/functionalities/aarch64.
