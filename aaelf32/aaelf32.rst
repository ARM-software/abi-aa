Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You
under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the License_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

Contributions
-------------

Contributions to this project are licensed under an inbound=outbound
model such that any such contributions are licensed by the contributor
under the same terms as those in the License_ section.

About This Document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI specifications:

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

All content in this document is at the **Release** quality level.

  |       |                     | on entry.  Added rules governing       |
  |       |                     | SHF_MERGE optimizations (`Merging of   |
  |       |                     | objects in sections with SHF_MERGE`_). |

  |       |                     | of 32-bit thumb relocations. In        |
  |       |                     | `Relocation types`_ and `Relocations   |
  |       |                     | for thread-local storage`_, added      |
  |       |                     | new relocations to support an          |

  |       |                     | reduced the field masked by            |
  |       |                     | PT_ARM_ARCHEXT_ARCHMSK to 8 bits (no   |
  |       |                     | current value exceeds 4 bits).         |
  +-------+---------------------+----------------------------------------+

  |       |                     | bit-mask was incorrect). Corrected     |
  |       |                     | spelling of TLS relocations in         |
  |       |                     | `Relocations for thread-local          |

Terms and abbreviations
-----------------------

The ABI for the Arm Architecture uses the following terms and abbreviations.

AAPCS
   Procedure Call Standard for the Arm Architecture

ABI
   Application Binary Interface:

   1. The specifications to which an executable must conform in order to
      execute in a specific execution environment. For example, the
      Linux ABI for the Arm Architecture.

   2. A particular aspect of the specifications to which independently
      produced relocatable files must conform in order to be
      statically linkable and executable.  For example, the C++ ABI
      for the Arm Architecture, the Run-time ABI for the Arm
      Architecture, the C Library ABI for the Arm Architecture.

AEABI
   (Embedded) ABI for the Arm architecture (this ABI…)

Arm-based
   ... based on the Arm architecture ...

core registers
   The general purpose registers visible in the Arm architecture’s
   programmer’s model, typically r0-r12, SP, LR, PC, and CPSR.

EABI
   An ABI suited to the needs of embedded, and deeply embedded (sometimes
   called free standing), applications.

Q-o-I
   Quality of Implementation – a quality, behavior, functionality, or
   mechanism not required by this standard, but which might be provided by
   systems conforming to it. Q-o-I is often used to describe the
   tool-chain-specific means by which a standard requirement is met.

VFP
   The Arm architecture’s Floating Point architecture and instruction set.
   In this ABI, this abbreviation includes all floating point variants
   regardless of whether or not vector (V) mode is supported.

Scope
=====

This specification provides the processor-specific definitions required by ELF
[SCO-ELF_] for Arm based systems.

The ELF specification is part of the larger System V ABI specification where it
forms chapters 4 and 5.  However, the specification can be used in isolation as
a generic object and executable format.

`Platform Standards`_ of this document covers ELF related matters that are
platform specific.  Most of this material is related to the Base Platform ABI.

`Object Files`_ and `Program Loading and Dynamic Linking`_ of this document are
structured to correspond to chapters 4 and 5 of the ELF specification.
Specifically:

* `Object Files`_ covers object files and relocations

* `Program Loading and Dynamic Linking`_ covers program loading and dynamic linking.

There are several drafts of the ELF specification on the SCO web site.  This
specification is based on the December 2003 draft, which was the most recent
stable draft at the time this specification was developed.

Platform Standards
==================

Base Platform ABI (BPABI)
-------------------------

The BPABI is an abstract platform standard.  Platforms conforming to the BPABI
can generally share a common toolchain with minimal post-processing
requirements.

Symbol Versioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The BPABI uses the GNU-extended Solaris symbol versioning mechanism [SYM-VER_].

Concrete data structure descriptions can be found in :code:`/usr/include/sys/link.h`
(Solaris), :code:`/usr/include/elf.h` (Linux), in the Linux base specifications
[LSB_], and in Drepper’s paper [SYM-VER_]. Drepper provides more detail than
the summary here.

An object or executable file using symbol versioning shall set the
:code:`EI_OSABI` field in the ELF header to :code:`ELFOSABI_ARM_AEABI` or some
other appropriate operating-system specific value.

Symbol versioning sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symbol versioning adds three sections to an executable file (under the SVr4 ABI
these are included in the RO program segment). Each section can be located via
a ``DT_xxx`` entry in the file’s dynamic section.

* The version definitions section. This section defines:

  * The symbol versions associated with symbols exported from this executable
    file.

  * The version of the file itself.

* The version section.

  This section extends the dynamic symbol table with an extra Elf32_Half field
  for each symbol. The N\ :sup:`th` entry gives the index in the virtual table
  of versions (described below) of the version associated with the N\ :sup:`th`
  symbol.

* The versions needed section.

  This section describes the versions referred to by symbols not defined in
  this executable file. Each entry names a DSO and points to a list of versions
  needed from it. In effect this represents ``FROM DSO IMPORT Ver1, Ver2, …``. This
  section provides a record of the symbol bindings used by the static linker
  when the executable file was created.

In standard ELF style, both the version definitions section and the versions
needed section identify (via the ``sh_link`` field in their section headers) a
string table section (often ``.dynstr``) containing the textual values they refer
to.

.. rubric:: The (virtual) table of versions

When an executable file uses symbol versioning there is also a virtual table of
versions. This is not represented in the file (there is no corresponding file
component). It contains a row for each distinct version defined by, and needed
by, this file.

Each version defined, and each version needed, by this file carries its row
index in this virtual table, so the table can be constructed on demand. Indexes
2, 3, 4, and so on, are local to this file. Indexes 0 and 1 have predefined
global meanings, as do indexes with the top bit (0x8000) set.

Locating symbol versioning sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version definition section can be located via keys in the dynamic section, as follows.

+------------------------------------+---------+
| :code:`DT_VERDEF     (0x6FFFFFFC)` | address |
+------------------------------------+---------+
| :code:`DT_VERDEFNUM  (0x6FFFFFFD)` | count   |
+------------------------------------+---------+

This key pair identifies the head and length, of a list of version definitions
exported from this executable file. The list is not contiguous – each member
points to its successor.

The versions needed section can be located via keys in the dynamic section, as
follows.

+-------------------------------------+---------+
| :code:`DT_VERNEED     (0x6FFFFFFE)` | address |
+-------------------------------------+---------+
| :code:`DT_VERNEEDNUM  (0x6FFFFFFF)` | count   |
+-------------------------------------+---------+

This key pair identifies the head and length of a list of needed versions. Each
list member identifies a DSO imported from, and points to a sub-list of
versions used by symbols imported from that DSO at the time this executable
file was created by the static linker. Neither list need be contiguous – each
member points to its successor.

The version section can be located via a key in the dynamic section, as follows.

+--------------------------------+---------+
| :code:`DT_VERSYM (0x6FFFFFF0)` | address |
+--------------------------------+---------+

The version section adds a field to each dynamic symbol that identifies the
version of that symbol’s definition, or the version of that symbol needed to
satisfy that reference. The number of entries must be same as the number of
entries in the dynamic symbol table identified by :code:`DT_SYMTAB` and
:code:`DT_HASH` (and by the Arm-specific tag :code:`DT_ARM_SYMTABSZ`).

Version definition section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version definition section has the name :code:`.XXX_verdef` and the section
type :code:`SHT_XXX_verdef` (the names vary but the section type –
:code:`0x6FFFFFFD` – is the same for Solaris and Linux). Its :code:`sh_link`
field identifies the string table section (often :code:`.dynstr`) it refers to.

The version definition section defines a set of versions exported from this
file and the successor relationships among them.

Each version has a textual name, and two versions are the same if their names
compare equal. Textual names are represented by offsets into the associated
string table section. Names that must be processed during dynamic linking are
also hashed using the standard ELF hash function [SCO-ELF_].

Each version definition is linked to the next version definition via it vd_next
field which contains the byte offset from the start of this version definition
to the start of the next one. Zero marks the end of the list.

Each symbol exported from this shared object refers, via an index in the
version section, to one of these version definitions. If bit 15 of the index is
set, the symbol is hidden from static binding because it has an old version.

During static linking against this shared object, an undefined symbol can only
match an identically named ``STB_GLOBAL`` definition which refers to one of these
version definitions via an index with bit 15 clear.

Each top-level version definition links via its ``vd_aux`` field to a list of
version names. Each link contains the byte offset between the start of the
structure containing it and the start of the structure linked to. Zero marks
the end of the list. The first member of the list names the latest version,
hashed in the version definition’s ``vd_hash`` field. Subsequent members name
predecessor versions, but these are irrelevant to both static and dynamic
linking.

Symbol version section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The symbol version section has the name ``.XXX_versym`` and the section type
``SHT_XXX_versym`` (the names vary but the section type – ``0x6FFFFFFF`` – is the same
for Solaris and Linux).

The symbol version section is a table of ELF32_Half values. The N\ :sup:`th`
entry in the section corresponds to the N\ :sup:`th` symbol in the dynamic
symbol table.

* 0 if the symbol is local to this executable file.

* 1 if the symbol is undefined and unbound (to be bound dynamically), or if the
  symbol is defined and names the version of the executable file (usually a
  shared object) itself.

* The index (> 1) of the corresponding version definition, or version needed,
  in the virtual table of versions (described in
  `Symbol versioning sections`_).

This is the same value as is stored in the ``vd_ndx`` field of a version
definition structure and the ``vna_other`` field of a version needed auxiliary
structure.

Bit 15 of the index is set to denote that this is an old version of the
symbol. Such symbols are not used during static binding, but may be linked to
during dynamic linking.

Versions needed section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The versions needed section has the name ``.XXX_verneed`` and the section type
``SHT_XXX_verneed`` (the names vary but the section type – ``0x6FFFFFFE`` – is the same
for Solaris and Linux). Its ``sh_link`` field identifies the string table section
(often ``.dynstr``) it refers to.

The versions needed section contains a list of needed DSOs, and the symbol
versions needed from them.

Within each version needed structure, the ``vn_file`` field is the offset in the
associated string section of the ``SONAME`` of the needed DSO, and the ``vn_next``
field contains the byte offset from the start of this version needed structure
to the start of its successor.

Each version needed structure links to a sub-list of needed versions via a byte
offset to the start of the first member in its ``vn_aux field``. In effect this
represents ``FROM DSO IMPORT Ver1, Ver2, ...``

Each version needed auxiliary structure contains its index in the virtual table
of versions in its ``vna_other`` field. The ``vna_name`` field contains the offset in
the associated string table of the name of the required version.

Symbol Pre-emption in DLLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under SVr4, symbol pre-emption occurs at dynamic link time, controlled by the
dynamic linker, so there is nothing to encode in a DSO.

In the DLL-creating tool flow, pre-emption happens off line and must be
recorded in a BPABI executable file in a form that can be conveniently
processed by a post linker. If there is to be any pre-emption when a process is
created, what to do must be recorded in the platform executable produced by the
post linker.

Pre-emption Map Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Static preemption data is recorded in a special section in the object file.
The map is recorded in the dynamic section with the tag ``DT_ARM_PREEMPTMAP``,
which contains the virtual address of the map.

In the section view, the pre-emption map special section is called
``.ARM.preemptmap``. It has type ``SHT_ARM_PREEMPTMAP``. In common with other sections
that refer to a string table, its ``sh_link`` field contains the section index of
an associated string table.

The map contains a sequence of entries of the form:

.. code-block::

  Elf32_Word count			// Count of pre-empted definitions following
  Elf32_Word symbol-name		// Offset in the associated string table
  Elf32_Word pre-empting-DLL		// Offset in the associated string table
  Elf32_Word pre-empted-DLL		// Offset in the associated string table
  ...					//

The map is terminated by a count of zero.

If ``count`` is non-zero, the next two words identify the name of the symbol being
pre-empted and the name (``SONAME``) of the executable file providing the
pre-empting definition. This structure is followed by ``count`` words each of which
identifies the ``SONAME`` of an executable file whose definition of ``symbol-name`` is
pre-empted.

``Symbol-name`` is the offset in the associated string table section of a
NUL-terminated byte string (NTBS) that names a symbol defined in a dynamic
symbol table. This value must not be 0.

Each of ``pre-empting-DLL`` and ``pre-empted-DLL`` is an offset in the associated
string table section of an NTBS naming a DLL. The name used is the shared
object name (``SONAME``) cited by ``DT_NEEDED`` dynamic tags. The root executable file
does not have a ``SONAME``, so its name is encoded as 0.

PLT Sequences and Usage Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Symbols for which a PLT entry must be generated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A PLT entry implements a long-branch to a destination outside of this
executable file. In general, the static linker knows only the name of the
destination. It does not know its address or instruction-set state. Such a
location is called an imported location or imported symbol.

Some targets (specifically SVr4-based DSOs) also require functions exported
from an executable file to have PLT entries. In effect, exported functions are
treated as if they were imported, so that their definitions can be overridden
(pre-empted) at dynamic link time.

A linker must generate a PLT entry for each candidate symbol cited by a
BL-class relocation directive.

* For an SVr4-based DSO, each ``STB_GLOBAL`` symbol with ``STV_DEFAULT`` visibility is
  a candidate.

* For all other platforms conforming to this ABI, only non-``WEAK``, not hidden (by
  ``STV_HIDDEN``), undefined, ``STB_GLOBAL`` symbols are candidates.

.. note::
   When targeting DLL-based and bare platforms, relocations that cite ``WEAK``
   undefined symbols must be performed by the static linker using the
   appropriate NULL value of the relocation. No ``WEAK`` undefined symbols are
   copied to the dynamic symbol table. ``WEAK`` definitions may be copied to the
   dynamic table, but it is Q-o-I whether a dynamic linker will take any
   account of the ``WEAK`` attribute. In contrast, SVr4-based platforms process
   ``WEAK`` at dynamic link time.

Overview of PLT entry code generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A PLT entry must be able to branch any distance to either instruction-set
state. The span and state are fixed when the executable is linked dynamically.
A PLT entry must therefore end with code similar to the following.

+------------------------------+-----------------------+
| Arm V5 and later             | Arm V4T               |
+==============================+=======================+
|   ``LDR pc, Somewhere``      | ``LDR ip, Somewhere`` |
|                              |                       |
|                              | ``BX  ip``            |
+------------------------------+-----------------------+
|   ``Somewhere: DCD Destination``                     |
+------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::
   There is no merit in making the final step PC-relative. A location must be
   written at dynamic link time and at that time the target address must be
   known [even if dynamic linking is performed off line]. Similarly, it is
   generally pointless trying to construct a PLT entry entirely in 16-bit Thumb
   instructions. Even with the overhead of an inline Thumb-to-Arm state change,
   an Arm-state entry is usually smaller and always faster.

The table below summarizes the code generation variants a static linker must
support. PLT refers to the read-only component of the veneer and PLTGOT to the
corresponding writable function pointer.

  +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+

Following subsections present specimen Arm code sequences appropriate to the
right hand column. In each case simplification to the direct (no PLTGOT) case
is shown in the left hand column.

Note also that:

* In each case we assume Arm architecture V5 or later, and omit the 4-byte
  Thumb-to-Arm prelude that is needed to support Thumb-state callers.

* Under Arm architecture V4T, in the two DLL cases shown in the first column
  above, the final ``LDR pc, …``, can be replaced by ``LDR ip, …; BX ip``.

* In the case of SVr4 linkage there is an additional constraint to support
  incremental dynamic linking, namely that ``ip`` must address the corresponding
  PLTGOT entry. This constraint is most easily met under architecture V4T by
  requiring DSOs to be entered in Arm state (but more complex solutions are
  possible).

* Other platforms are free to impose the same constraint if they support
  incremental dynamic linking.

PLT relocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A post linker may need to distinguish PLTGOT-generating relocations from
GOT-generating ones.

If the static linker were generating a relocatable ELF file it would naturally
generate the PLT into its own section (``.plt``, say), subject to relocations from
a corresponding relocation section (``.rel.plt`` say). No other GOT-generating
relocations can occur in ``.rel.plt``, so that section would contain all the
PLTGOT-generating relocations. By the usual collation rules of static linking,
in a subsequent executable file-producing link step those relocations would end
up in a contiguous sub-range of the dynamic relocation section.

The ELF standard requires that the GOT-generating relocations of the PLT are
emitted into a contiguous sub-range of the dynamic relocation section. That
sub-range is denoted by the standard tags ``DT_JMPREL`` and ``DT_PLTRELSZ``.  The type
of relocations (``REL`` or ``RELA``) is stored in the ``DT_PLTREL`` tag.

ELF Header
----------

The ELF header provides a number of fields that assist in interpretation of the
file.  Most of these are specified in the base standard.  The following fields
have Arm-specific meanings.

e_type
  There are currently no Arm-specific object file types.  All values between
  ``ET_LOPROC`` and ``ET_HIPROC`` are reserved to future revisions of this
  specification.

e_machine
  An object file conforming to this specification must have the value ``EM_ARM``
  (40, 0x28).

e_entry
  The value stored in this field is treated like any other code pointer.
  Specifically, if bit[0] is 0b1 then the entry point contains Thumb code;
  while bit[1:0] = 0b00 implies that the entry point contains Arm code.  The
  combination bit[1:0] = 0b10 is reserved.

  The base ELF specification requires this field to be zero if an application
  does not have an entry point.  Nonetheless, some applications may require an
  entry point of zero (for example, via the reset vector).

  A platform standard may specify that an executable file always has an entry
  point, in which case e_entry specifies that entry point, even if zero.

e_flags
  The processor-specific flags are shown in the following table. Unallocated
  bits, and bits allocated in previous versions of this specification, are
  reserved to future revisions of this specification.

ELF Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 16-byte ELF identification (``e_ident``) provides information on how to
interpret the file itself.  The following values shall be used on Arm systems

EI_CLASS
  An Arm ELF file shall contain ``ELFCLASS32`` objects.

EI_DATA
  This field may be either ``ELFDATA2LSB`` or ``ELFDATA2MSB``.  The choice will be
  governed by the default data order in the execution environment.  On an
  Architecture v6 processor operating in BE8 mode all instructions are in
  little-endian format.  An executable image suitable for operation in this
  mode will have ``EF_ARM_BE8`` set in the ``e_flags`` field.

EI_OSABI
  This field shall be zero unless the file uses objects that have flags which
  have OS-specific meanings (for example, it makes use of a section index in
  the range ``SHN_LOOS`` through ``SHN_HIOS``). Processor-specific values for
  this field are defined in the following table.

.. class:: aaelf32-elf-flags

  | Value              | Meaning                                                          |
  +====================+==================================================================+
  | ELFOSABI_ARM_AEABI | The object contains symbol versioning extensions as described in |

See `Build Attributes`_.

Section Attribute Flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The defined processor-specific section attribute flags are listed in the
following table. All other processor-specific values are reserved to future
revisions of this specification.

.. class:: aaelf32-numbered-flags

.. table:: Processor specific section attribute flags

  +------------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Name             | Value      | Comment                                                                             |

  | SHF_ARM_PURECODE | 0x20000000 | The contents of this section contains only program instructions and no program data |
  +------------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If any section contained by a segment does not have the SHF_ARM_PURECODE
section flag set, the PF_R segment flag must be set in the program header for
the segment. If all sections contained by a segment have the SHF_ARM_PURECODE
section flag, a linker may optionally clear the PF_R segment flag in the
program header of the segment, to signal to the runtime that the program does
not rely on being able to read that segment.

Merging of objects in sections with SHF_MERGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a section with the SHF_MERGE flag set, duplicate used objects may be merged
and unused objects may be removed.  An object is used if:

* A relocation directive addresses the object via the section symbol with a
  suitable addend to point to the object.

* A relocation directive addresses a symbol within the section. The used object
  is the one addressed by the symbol irrespective of the addend used.

Special Sections

Names beginning ``.ARM.exidx`` name sections containing index entries for section
unwinding. Names beginning ``.ARM.extab`` name sections containing exception
unwinding information. See [EHABI] for details.

``.ARM.preemptmap`` names a section that contains a BPABI DLL dynamic linking
pre-emption map. See `Pre-emption Map Format`_.

``.ARM.attributes`` names a section that contains build attributes.
See `Build Attributes`_.

``.ARM.debug_overlay`` and ``.ARM.overlay_table`` name sections used by the
Debugging Overlaid Programs ABI extension described in DBGOVL32_.

Additional special sections may be required by some platforms standards.

Section Alignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is no minimum alignment required for a section.  However, sections
containing thumb code must be at least 16-bit aligned and sections containing
Arm code must be at least 32-bit aligned.

Platform standards may set a limit on the maximum alignment that they can
guarantee (normally the page size).

Build Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build attributes are encoded in a section of type ``SHT_ARM_ATTRIBUTES``, and name
``.ARM.attributes``.

The content of the section is a stream of bytes. Numbers other than subsection
sizes are encoded numbers using unsigned LEB128 encoding (ULEB128), DWARF-3
style [GDWARF_].

Attributes are divided into sub-sections.  Each subsection is prefixed by the
name of the vendor.  There is one subsection that is defined by the “aeabi”
pseudo-vendor and contains general information about compatibility of the
object file.  Attributes defined in vendor-specific sections are private to the
vendor.  In a conforming object file the information recorded in a
vendor-specific section may be safely ignored if it is not understood.

Most build attributes naturally apply to a whole translation unit; however,
others might apply more naturally to a section or to a function (symbol of type
``STT_FUNC``).  To permit precise description of attributes the syntax permits
three granularities of translation at which an attribute can be expressed.

A section inherits the attributes of the file of which it is a component.  A
symbol definition inherits the attributes of the section in which it is
defined.  Attributes that cannot apply to the smaller entity are not inherited.

.. note::
   Attributes that naturally apply to a translation unit may, nonetheless, end
   up applying to a section if sections from distinct relocatable files are
   combined into a single relocatable file by "partial linking". Similar
   exceptions may occur at the function level through use of #pragma and other
   Q-o-I tool chain behavior.

   Explicit per-section and per-symbol data should be generated only when it
   cannot be implied by this inheritance.  Being explicit is more verbose, and the
   explicit options are intended to capture exceptions.

Syntactic structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The overall syntactic structure of an attributes section is:

.. code-block::

  <format-version>
  [ <section-length> "vendor-name"
  	[ <file-tag> <size> <attribute>*
  	| <section-tag> <size> <section-number>* 0 <attribute>*
  	| <symbol-tag> <size> <symbol-number>* 0 <attribute>*
  	]+
  ]*

*Format-version* describes the format of the following data.  It is a single byte
(not ULEB128).  This is version 'A' (0x41).  This field exists to permit future
incompatible changes in format.

*Section-length* is a 4-byte unsigned integer in the byte order of the ELF file.
It contains the length of the vendor-specific data, including the length field
itself, the vendor name string and its terminating NUL byte, and the following
attribute data. That is, it is the offset from the start of this vendor
subsection to the start of the next vendor subsection.

*Vendor-name* is a NUL-terminated byte string in the style of a C string.  Vendor
names begining “Anon” or “anon” are reserved to unregistered private use.

.. note::
   In general, a ``.ARM.attributes`` section in a relocatable file will contain a
   vendor subsection from the "aeabi" pseudo vendor and, optionally, one from
   the generating tool chain (e.g. "Arm", "gnu", "WRS", etc) as listed in
   `Registered Vendor Names`_.

It is required that:

* Attributes that record facts about the compatibility of this relocatable file
  with other relocatable files are recorded in the public "aeabi" subsection.

* Attributes meaningful only to the producer are recorded in the private vendor
  subsection. These must not affect compatibility between relocatable files
  unless that is recorded in the "aeabi" subsection using generic compatibility
  tags.

* Generic compatibility tags must record a "safe" approximation. A tool chain
  may record more precise information that only that tool chain comprehends.

.. note::
   The intent is that a "foreign" tool chain should not mistakenly link
   incompatible binary files. The consequence is that a foreign tool chain
   might sometimes refuse to link files that could be safely linked, because
   their incompatibility has been crudely approximated.

There are no constraints on the order or number of vendor subsections. A
consumer can collect the public ("aeabi") attributes in a single pass over the
section, then all of its private data in a second pass.

A vendor-attributes subsection may contain any number of sub-subsections. Each
records attributes relating to:

* The whole relocatable file.  These sub-subsections contain just a list of
  attributes.

* A set of sections within the relocatable file.  These sub-subsections contain
  a list of section numbers followed by a list of attributes.

* A set of (defined) symbols in the relocatable file.  These sub-subsections
  contain a list of symbol numbers followed by a list of attributes.

A sub-subsection starts with a tag that identifies the type of the
sub-subsection (file, section, or symbol), followed by a 4-byte unsigned
integer size in the byte-order of the ELF file.  The size is the total size of
the sub-subsection including the tag, the size itself, and the sub-subsection
content.

Both section indexes and defined symbol indexes are non-zero, so a NUL byte
ends a string and a list of indexes.

There are no constraints on the order or number of sub-subsections in a vendor
subsection. A consumer that needs the data in inheritance order can obtain the
file attributes, the section-related attributes, and the symbol-related
attributes, by making three passes over the subsection.

A public attribute is encoded as a tag (non zero, ULEB128-encoded followed by a
value. A public value is either an enumeration constant (ULEB128-encoded) or a
NUL-terminated string.

Some examples of tags and their argument sorts include:

.. code-block::

  Tag_CPU_raw_name <string>  -- 0x04, "ML692000"
  Tag_CPU_name     <string>  -- 0x05, "Arm946E-S"
  Tag_PCS_R9_use   <uleb128> -- 0x0E, 0x01 (R9 used as SB)
  Tag_PCS_config   <uleb128> -- 0x0D, 0x03 (Linux DSO [/fpic] configuration)

Top level structure tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following tags are defined globally:

.. code-block::

  Tag_File, (=1), uleb128:byte-size
  Tag_Section, (=2), uleb128:byte-size
  Tag_Symbol, (=3), uleb128:byte-size

String Table
------------

There are no processor-specific extensions to the string table.

Symbol Table
------------

There are no processor-specific symbol types or symbol bindings.  All
processor-specific values are reserved to future revisions of this
specification.

Weak Symbols
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two forms of weak symbol:

* A weak reference — This is denoted by ``st_shndx=SHN_UNDEF,
  ELF32_ST_BIND()=STB_WEAK``.

* A weak definition — This is denoted by ``st_shndx!=SHN_UNDEF,
  ELF32_ST_BIND()=STB_WEAK``.

Weak References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries are not searched to resolve weak references.  It is not an error for
a weak reference to remain unsatisfied.

During linking, the value of an undefined weak reference is:

* Zero if the relocation type is absolute

* The address of the place if the relocation type is pc-relative

*  The nominal base address if the relocation type is base-relative.

See `Relocation`_ for further details.

Weak Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A weak definition does not change the rules by which object files are selected
from libraries.  However, if a link set contains both a weak definition and a
non-weak definition, the non-weak definition will always be used.

Symbol Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

All code symbols exported from an object file (symbols with binding ``STB_GLOBAL``)
shall have type ``STT_FUNC``.

All extern data objects shall have type ``STT_OBJECT``.  No ``STB_GLOBAL`` data symbol
shall have type ``STT_FUNC``.

The type of an undefined symbol shall be ``STT_NOTYPE`` or the type of its expected
definition.

The type of any other symbol defined in an executable section can be
``STT_NOTYPE``.  The linker is only required to provide interworking support for
symbols of type ``STT_FUNC`` (interworking for untyped symbols must be encoded
directly in the object file).

Symbol Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the normal rules for symbol values the following rules shall
also apply to symbols of type ``STT_FUNC``:

* If the symbol addresses an Arm instruction, its value is the address of the
  instruction (in a relocatable object, the offset of the instruction from the
  start of the section containing it).

* If the symbol addresses a Thumb instruction, its value is the address of the
  instruction with bit zero set (in a relocatable object, the section offset
  with bit zero set).

* For the purposes of relocation the value used shall be the address of the
  instruction (``st_value & ~1``).

.. note::
   This allows a linker to distinguish Arm and Thumb code symbols without
   having to refer to the map.  An Arm symbol will always have an even value,
   while a Thumb symbol will always have an odd value.  However, a linker
   should strip the discriminating bit from the value before using it for
   relocation.

Symbol names
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A symbol that names a C or assembly language entity should have the name of
that entity.  For example, a C function called ``calculate`` generates a symbol
called ``calculate`` (not ``_calculate``).

Symbol names are case sensitive and are matched exactly by linkers.

Any symbol with binding ``STB_LOCAL`` may be removed from an object and replaced
with an offset from another symbol in the same section under the following
conditions:

* The original symbol and replacement symbol are not of type STT_FUNC, or both
  symbols are of type STT_FUNC and describe code of the same execution type
  (either both Arm or both Thumb).

* All relocations referring to the symbol can accommodate the adjustment in the
  addend field (it is permitted to convert a ``REL`` type relocation to a ``RELA`` type
  relocation).

* The symbol is not described by the debug information.

* The symbol is not a mapping symbol.

* The resulting object, or image, is not required to preserve accurate symbol
  information to permit decompilation or other post-linking optimization
  techniques.

* If the symbol labels an object in a section with the SHF_MERGE flag set, the
  relocation using symbol may be changed to use the section symbol only if the
  initial addend of the relocation is zero.

No tool is required to perform the above transformations; an object consumer
must be prepared to do this itself if it might find the additional symbols
confusing.

.. note::
   Multiple conventions exist for the names of compiler temporary symbols (for
   example, ARMCC uses ``Lxxx.yyy``, while GNU uses ``.Lxxx``).

Reserved symbol names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following symbols are reserved to this and future revisions of this
specification:

* Local symbols (STB_LOCAL) beginning with ``$``

* Global symbols (STB_GLOBAL, STB_WEAK) beginning with ``__aeabi_``
  (double ``_`` at start).

* Global symbols (STB_GLOBAL, STB_WEAK) ending with any of ``$$base``,
  ``$$length`` or ``$$limit``

* Symbols matching the pattern ``${Ven|other}${AA|AT|TA|TT}${I|L|S}[$PI]$$symbol``

* Local symbols (STB_LOCAL) beginning with ``Lib$Request$$`` or
  ``BuildAttributes$$``

* Symbols beginning with ``$Sub$$`` or ``$Super$$``

Note that global symbols beginning with ``__vendor_`` (double ``_`` at start),
where vendor is listed in `Registered Vendor Names`_, Registered Vendor Names,
are reserved to the named vendor for the purpose of providing vendor-specific
tool-chain support functions.

Conventions for reserved symbols for which support is not required by this ABI
are described in `Appendix: Conventions for symbols containing $`_.

Mapping symbols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A section of an ELF file can contain a mixture of Arm code, Thumb code and
data.

There are inline transitions between code and data at literal pool boundaries.
There can also be inline transitions between Arm code and Thumb code, for
example in Arm-Thumb inter-working veneers.

Linkers, and potentially other tools, need to map images correctly (for
example, to support byte swapping to produce a BE-8 image from a BE-32 object
file).  To support this, a number of symbols, termed mapping symbols appear in
the symbol table to denote the start of a sequence of bytes of the appropriate
type.  All mapping symbols have type STT_NOTYPE and binding STB_LOCAL.  The
st_size field is unused and must be zero.

The mapping symbols are defined in the following table. It is an error for a
relocation to reference a mapping symbol. Two forms of mapping symbol are
supported:

* a short form, that uses a dollar character and a single letter denoting the
  class.  This form can be used when an object producer creates mapping symbols
  automatically, and minimizes symbol table space * a longer form, where the
  short form is extended with a period and then any sequence of characters that
  are legal for a symbol.  This form can be used when assembler files have to
  be annotated manually and the assembler does not support multiple definitions
  of symbols.

Section-relative mapping symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapping symbols defined in a section define a sequence of half-open address
intervals that cover the address range of the section.  Each interval starts at
the address defined by the mapping symbol, and continues up to, but not
including, the address defined by the next (in address order) mapping symbol or
the end of the section. A section must have a mapping symbol defined at the
beginning of the section; however, if the section contains only data then the
mapping symbol may be omitted.

Absolute mapping symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapping symbols are no-longer required for the absolute section.  The
equivalent information is now conveyed by the type of the absolute symbol.

Relocation
----------

Relocation information is used by linkers in order to bind symbols and
addresses that could not be determined when the initial object was generated.
In these descriptions, references in the style LDR(1) refer to the Armv5
Architecture Reference Manual [Armv5 ARM] while those in the style
LDR(immediate, Thumb) give the corresponding reference to the Arm Architecture
Reference Manual Arm v7-A and Arm v7-R edition [ARMARM_].

Relocation codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The relocation codes for Arm are divided into four categories:

* Mandatory relocations that must be supported by all static linkers

* Platform-specific relocations that are required for specific virtual
  platforms

* Private relocations that are guaranteed never to be allocated in future
  revisions of this specification, but which must never be used in portable
  object files.

* Unallocated relocations that are reserved for use in future revisions of this
  specification.

Addends and PC-bias compensation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A binary file may use REL or RELA relocations or a mixture of the two (but
multiple relocations for the same address must use only one type).  If the
relocation is pc-relative then compensation for the PC bias (the PC value is 8
bytes ahead of the executing instruction in Arm state and 4 bytes in Thumb
state) must be encoded in the relocation by the object producer.

Unless specified otherwise, the initial addend for REL type relocations is
formed according to the following rules.

* If the place is subject to a data-type relocation, the initial value in the
  place is sign-extended to 32 bits.

* If the place contains an instruction, the immediate field for the instruction
  is extracted from it and used as the initial addend.  If the instruction is a
  SUB, or an LDR/STR type instruction with the ‘up’ bit clear, then the initial
  addend is formed by negating the unsigned immediate value encoded in the

If the initial addend cannot be encoded in the space available then a RELA
format relocation must be used.

There are three special cases for forming the initial addend of REL-type
relocations where the immediate field cannot normally hold small signed
integers:

* For relocations processing MOVW and MOVT instructions (in both Arm and Thumb
  state), the initial addend is formed by interpreting the 16-bit literal field
  of the instruction as a 16-bit signed value in the range -32768 <= A < 32768.
  The interpretation is the same whether the relocated place contains a MOVW
  instruction or a MOVT instruction.

* For R_ARM_THM_JUMP6 the initial addend is formed by the formula (((imm + 4) &
  0x7f) – 4), where imm is the concatenation of bit[9]:bit[7:3]:’0’ from the
  Thumb CBZ or CBNZ instruction being relocated.

* For R_ARM_THM_PC8 the initial addend is formed by the formula (((imm + 4) &
  0x3ff) – 4), where imm is the 32-bit value encoded in the 8-bit place, as
  defined in the LDR(3)/LDR(literal) Thumb instructions section of the
  [ARMARM_].

Relocation types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Relocation codes table`_, below, lists the relocation codes for Arm.
The table shows:

* The code which is stored in the ELF32_R_TYPE component of the r_info field.

* The mnemonic name for the relocation.

* The type of the relocation.  This field substantially divides the relocations
  into Static and Dynamic relocations.  Static relocations are processed by a
  static linker; they are normally either fully resolved or used to produce
  dynamic relocations for processing by a post-linking step or a dynamic
  loader. A well formed image will have no static relocations after static
  linking is complete, so a post-linker or dynamic loader will normally only
  have to deal with dynamic relocations.  This field is also used to describe
  deprecated, obsolete, private and unallocated relocation codes.  Deprecated
  codes should not be generated by fully conforming toolchains; however it is
  recognized that there may be substantial existing code that makes use of
  these forms, so it is expected that a linker may well be required to handle
  them at this time.  Obsolete codes should not be used, and it is believed
  that there is little or no common use of these values.  All unallocated codes
  are reserved for future allocation.

* The class of the relocation describes the type of place being relocated:
  these are Data, Arm, Thumb16 and Thumb32 (32-bit long-format instructions).
  A special class of Miscellaneous is used when the operation is not a simple
  mathematical expression.

* The operation field describes how the symbol and addend are processed by the
  relocation code.  It does not describe how the addend is formed (for a REL
  type relocation), what overflow checking is done, or how the value is written
  back into the place: this information is given in subsequent sections. In all
  cases, relocation expression values are computed mod 2\ :sup:`32`.

The following nomenclature is used for the operation:

* S (when used on its own) is the address of the symbol.

* A is the addend for the relocation.

* P is the address of the place being relocated (derived from r_offset).

* Pa is the adjusted address of the place being relocated, defined as (P &
  0xFFFFFFFC).

* T is 1 if the target symbol S has type STT_FUNC and the symbol addresses a
  Thumb instruction; it is 0 otherwise.

* B(S) is the addressing origin of the output segment defining the symbol S.
  The origin is not required to be the base address of the segment. This value
  must always be word-aligned.

* GOT_ORG is the addressing origin of the Global Offset Table (the indirection
  table for imported data addresses). This value must always be word-aligned.
  See `Proxy generating relocations`_.

* GOT(S) is the address of the GOT entry for the symbol S.

Static Data relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Except as indicated in the following table, all static data
relocations have size 4, alignment 1 and write the full 32-bit result to the
place; there is thus no need for overflow checking.

The overflow ranges for R_ARM_ABS16 and R_ARM_ABS8 permit either signed or
unsigned results.  It is therefore not possible to detect an unsigned value
that has underflowed by a small amount, or a signed value that has overflowed
by a small amount.

Static Arm relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The relocations that can modify fields of an Arm instruction are listed in the
following table. All relocations in this class relocate a 32-bit aligned Arm
instruction by modifying part of the instruction. In most cases the
modification is to change the offset, but in some cases the opcode itself may
be changed (for example, an ADD may be converted to a SUB and vice-versa). In
the table:

* X is the 32-bit result of normal relocation processing

* Gn is a mask operation that is instruction dependent.  See Group Relocations
  below for rules on how the mask is formed for each case.

The formation of the initial addend in a REL type relocation for the various
instruction classes is described in the following table. Insn modification
describes how the 32-bit result X is written back to the instruction;
Result_Mask is the value of X after the masking operation described in `Static
Arm instruction relocations`_ has been applied.

.. _Call and Jump relocations:

.. rubric:: Call and Jump relocations

There is one relocation (R_ARM_CALL) for unconditional function call
instructions (BLX and BL with the condition field set to 0xe), and one for jump
instructions (R_ARM_JUMP24).  The principal difference between the two
relocation values is the handling of Arm/Thumb inter-working: on Arm
architecture 5 and above, an instruction relocated by R_ARM_CALL that calls a
function that is entered in Thumb state may be relocated by changing the
instruction to BLX; an instruction relocated by R_ARM_JUMP24 must use a veneer
to effect the transition to Thumb state. Conditional function call instructions
(BL<cond>) must be relocated using R_ARM_JUMP24.

A linker may use a veneer (a sequence of instructions) to implement the
relocated branch if the relocation is one of R_ARM_PC24, R_ARM_CALL,
R_ARM_JUMP24, (or, in Thumb state, R_ARM_THM_CALL, R_ARM_THM_JUMP24, or
R_ARM_THM_JUMP19) and:

* The target symbol has type STT_FUNC

* Or, the target symbol and relocated place are in separate sections input to
  the linker

In all other cases a linker shall diagnose an error if relocation cannot be
effected without a veneer.  A linker generated veneer may corrupt register r12
(IP) and the condition flags, but must preserve all other registers. On
M-profile processors a veneer may also assume the presence of a stack with at
least 8 bytes (2 words) of memory.  Linker veneers may be needed for a number
of reasons, including, but not limited to:

* Target is outside the addressable span of the branch instruction (± 32Mb)

* Target address and execution state will not be known until run time, or the
  address might be pre-empted

In some systems indirect calls may also use veneers in order to support dynamic
linkage while preserving pointer equivalence.  On platforms that do not support
dynamic pre-emption of symbols an unresolved weak reference to a symbol
relocated by R_ARM_CALL (or, in Thumb state,  R_ARM_THM_CALL) shall be treated
as a jump to the next instruction (the call becomes a no-op). The behaviour of
R_ARM_JUMP24 and static Thumb jump relocations in these conditions is
implementation-defined.

.. rubric:: Group relocations

Relocation codes 4 and 57-83 are intended to relocate sequences of instructions
that generate a single address.  They are encoded to extract the maximum
flexibility from the Arm ADD- and SUB-immediate instructions without need to
determine during linking the full sequence being used.  The relocations operate
by performing the basic relocation calculation and then partitioning the result
into a set of groups of bits that can be statically determined.  All processing
for the formation of the groups is done on the absolute value of X; the sign of
X is used to determine whether ADD or SUB instructions are used, or, if the
sequence concludes with a load/store operation, the setting of the U bit (bit
23) in the instruction.

A group, G\ :sub:`n`, is formed by examining the residual value, Y\ :sub:`n`, after
the bits for group G\ :sub:`n–1` have been masked off.  Processing for group
G\ :sub:`0` starts with the absolute value of X.  For ALU-type relocations a
group is formed by determining the most significant bit (MSB) in the residual
and selecting the smallest constant K\ :sub:`n` such that

  MSB(Y\ :sub:`n`) & (255 << 2K\ :sub:`n`) != 0,

except that if Y\ :sub:`n` is 0, then K\ :sub:`n` is 0.  The value G\ :sub:`n` is
then

  Y\ :sub:`n` & (255 << 2K\ :sub:`n`),

and the residual, Y\ :sub:`n+1`, for the next group is

  Y\ :sub:`n` & ~G\ :sub:`n`.

Note that if Y\ :sub:`n` is 0, then G\ :sub:`n` will also be 0.

For group relocations that access memory the residual value is examined in its
entirety (i.e. after the appropriate sequence of ALU groups have been removed):
if the relocation has not overflowed, then the residual for such an instruction
will always be a valid offset for the indicated type of memory access.

Overflow checking is always performed on the highest-numbered group in a
sequence.  For ALU-type relocations the result has overflowed if Y\ :sub:`n+1` is not
zero.  For memory access relocations the result has overflowed if the residual
is not a valid offset for the type of memory access.

.. note::
   The unchecked (_NC) group relocations all include processing of the Thumb
   bit of a symbol.  However, the memory forms of group relocations (eg
   R_ARM_LDR_G0) ignore this bit.  Therefore the use of the memory forms with
   symbols of type STT_FUNC is unpredictable.

Static Thumb16 relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relocations for 16-bit thumb instructions are shown in the following table. In
general the addressing range of these relocations is too small for them to
reference external symbols and they are documented here for completeness. A
linker is not required to generate trampoline sequences (or veneers) to extend
the branching range of the jump relocations.

Relocation R_ARM_THM_JUMP6 is only applicable to the Thumb-2 instruction set.

The formation of the initial addend in a REL type relocation for the various
instruction classes is described in the following table.  Insn modification describes how the
result X is written back to the instruction; Result_Mask is the value of X
after the masking operation described in `Static Thumb-16 relocations`_
or `Static Thumb-32 instruction relocations`_ has been applied.

.. _Thumb call and jump relocations:

.. rubric:: Thumb call and jump relocations

R_ARM_THM_CALL is used to relocate Thumb BL (and Armv5 Thumb BLX) instructions.
It is the Thumb equivalent of R_ARM_CALL and the same rules on conversion
apply.  Bits 0-10 of the first half-word encode the most significant bits of
the branch offset, bits 0-10 of the second half-word encode the least
significant bits and the offset is in units of half-words.  Thus 22 bits encode
a branch offset of ± 2\ :sup:`22` bytes.  When linking Armv6 (and later, see [ARM
ARM]) Thumb code the range of the branch is increased by 2 bits, increasing the
offset range to ± 2\ :sup:`24` bytes. The same relocation is used for both cases since
a linker need only know that the code will run on a Thumb-2 (Armv6 and later)
capable processor to exploit the additional range.

The addend for B.W and B<cond>.W is the signed immediate quantity encoded in
the instruction, extracted in a similar way to BL; for details see [ARMARM_].

The conditions under which call and jump relocations are permitted to generate
an ip-corrupting intra-call veneer,  and their behaviour in conjunction with
unresolved weak references, are specified in `Static Arm relocations`_
under the heading Call and Jump relocations.

Static miscellaneous relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

R_ARM_NONE records that the section containing the place to be relocated
depends on the section defining the symbol mentioned in the relocation
directive in a way otherwise invisible to the static linker.  The effect is to
prevent removal of sections that might otherwise appear to be unused.

R_ARM_V4BX records the location of an Armv4t BX instruction.  This enables a
static linker to generate Armv4 compatible images from Armv4t objects
containing only Arm code by converting the instruction to MOV PC, r, where r is
the register used in the BX instruction.  See AAPCS32_ for
details.  The symbol is unused and may even be the NULL symbol (index 0).

R_ARM_TARGET1 is processed in a platform-specific manner. It may only be used
in sections with the types SHT_INIT_ARRAY, SHT_PREINIT_ARRAY, and
SHT_FINI_ARRAY.  The relocation must be processed either in the same way as
R_ARM_REL32 or as R_ARM_ABS32: a virtual platform must specify which method is
used.  If the relocation is processed as R_ARM_REL32 then the section may be
marked read-only and coalesced with other read-only data, otherwise it may only
be marked read-only if it does not require dynamic linking.

R_ARM_TARGET2 is processed in a platform-specific manner. It is used to encode
a data dependency that will only be dereferenced by code in the run-time
support library.

Proxy generating relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of relocations generate proxy locations that are then subject to
dynamic relocation. The proxies are normally gathered together in a single
table, called the Global Offset Table or GOT. The following table lists the
relocations that generate proxy entries.

.. class:: aaelf32-proxy-relocs

  +------+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

All of the GOT entries generated by these relocations are subject to dynamic
relocation by R_ARM_GLOB_DAT of the symbol indicated in the generating
relocation.  There is no provision for generating an addend for the dynamic
entry.  GOT entries must always be 32-bit aligned words.  Multiple
GOT-generating relocations referencing the same symbol may share a single entry
in the GOT.

R_ARM_GOT_BREL, R_ARM_GOT_BREL12 and R_ARM_THM_GOT_BREL12 generate an offset
from the addressing origin of the GOT.  To calculate the absolute address of an
entry it is necessary to add in the GOT’s addressing origin.  How the origin is
established depends on the execution environment and several relocations are
provided in support of it.

* R_ARM_BASE_PREL with the NULL symbol (symbol 0) will give the offset of the
  GOT origin from the address of the place.

* R_ARM_BASE_ABS with the NULL symbol will give the absolute address of the GOT
  origin.

* Other execution environments may require that the GOT origin be congruent
  with some other base. In these environments the appropriate means of
  establishing that base will apply.

In addition to the data generating relocations listed above the call and branch
relocations (R_ARM_CALL, R_ARM_THM_CALL, R_ARM_JUMP24, R_ARM_THM_JUMP24,
R_ARM_THM_JUMP19) may also require a proxy to be generated if the symbol will
be defined in an external executable or may be pre-empted at execution time.
The details of proxy sequences and locations are described in
`PLT Sequences and Usage Models`_.

R_ARM_GOTRELAX is reserved to permit future-linker based optimizations of GOT
addressing sequences.

Relocations for thread-local storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The static relocations needed to support thread-local storage in a SVr4-type
environment are listed in the following table.

.. table:: Static TLS relocations

  +------+------------------+---------+-----------------------+

R_ARM_TLS_GD32 causes two adjacent entries to be added to the dynamically
relocated section (the Global Offset Table, or GOT).  The first of these is
dynamically relocated by R_ARM_TLS_DTPMOD32, the second by R_ARM_TLS_DTPOFF32.
The place resolves to the offset of the first of the GOT entries from the
place.

R_ARM_TLS_LDM32 is the same as R_ARM_TLS_GD32 except that the second slot in
the GOT is initialized to zero and has no dynamic relocation.

R_ARM_TLS_LDO32 resolves to the offset of the referenced data object (which
must be local to the module) from the origin of the TLS block for the current
module.

R_ARM_TLS_LDO12 is the same as R_ARM_TLS_LDO32 except that the result of the
relocation is encoded as the 12-bit offset of an Arm LDR instruction.

R_ARM_TLS_LE32 resolves to the offset of the referenced data object (which must
be in the initial data block) from the thread pointer ($tp).

R_ARM_TLS_LE12 is the same as R_ARM_TLS_LE32 except that the result of the
relocation is encoded as the 12-bit offset of an Arm LDR instruction.

R_ARM_TLS_IE32 allocates an entry in the GOT that is dynamically relocated by
R_ARM_TLS_TPOFF32.  The place resolves to the offset of the GOT entry from the
place.

R_ARM_TLS_IE12GP allocates an entry in the GOT that is dynamically relocated by
R_ARM_TLS_TPOFF32.  The place resolved to the offset of the GOT entry from the
origin of the GOT and is encoded in the 12-bit offset of an Arm LDR
instruction.

.. rubric:: New experimental TLS relocations

TLSDESC_ contains a proposal for enhanced performance of TLS code. At
this stage the proposal is still experimental, but the relocations
R_ARM_TLS_DESC, R_ARM_TLS_GOTDESC, R_ARM_TLS_CALL, R_ARM_TLS_DESCSEQ,
R_ARM_THM_TLS_CALL, R_ARM_THM_TLS_DESCSEQ16 and
R_ARM_THM_TLS_DESCSEQ32 have been reserved to support this.

.. note::
   The relocation R_ARM_TLS_DESC re-uses relocation code from the now-obsolete
   R_ARM_SWI24, but since the former was a static relocation and the new
   relocation is dynamic there are no practical conflicts in usage.

Dynamic relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dynamic relocations for those execution environments that support only a
limited number of run-time relocation types are listed in the following table.

  +------+----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

With the exception of R_ARM_COPY all dynamic relocations require that the place
being relocated is a word-aligned 32-bit object.

R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT is used to mark code targets that will be executed.  On
platforms that support dynamic binding the relocations may be performed lazily
on demand.  The unresolved address stored in the place will initially point to
the entry sequence stub for the dynamic linker and must be adjusted during
initial loading by the offset of the load address of the segment from its link
address.  Addresses stored in the place of these relocations may not be used
for pointer comparison until the relocation has been resolved.  In a REL form
of this relocation the addend, A, is always 0.

R_ARM_COPY may only appear in executable objects where e_type is set to
ET_EXEC.  The effect is to cause the dynamic linker to locate the target symbol
in a shared library object and then to copy the number of bytes specified by
the st_size field to the place.  The address of the place is then used to
pre-empt all other references to the specified symbol.  It is an error if the
storage space allocated in the executable is insufficient to hold the full copy
of the symbol.  If the object being copied contains dynamic relocations then
the effect must be as if those relocations were performed before the copy was
made.

.. note::
   R_ARM_COPY is normally only used in SVr4 type environments where the
   executable is not position independent and references by the code and
   read-only data sections cannot be relocated dynamically to refer to an
   object that is defined in a shared library.

   The need for copy relocations can be avoided if a compiler generates all
   code references to such objects indirectly through a dynamically relocatable
   location, and if all static data references are placed in relocatable
   regions of the image.  In practice, however, this is difficult to achieve
   without source-code annotation; a better approach is to avoid defining
   static global data in shared libraries.

Deprecated relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deprecated relocations are in the process of being retired from the
specification and may be removed or marked obsolete in future revisions.  An
object file containing these codes is still conforming, but producers should be
changed to use the new alternatives.

The relocations R_ARM_GNU_VTENTRY and R_ARM_GNU_VTINHERIT have been used by
some toolchains to facilitate unused virtual function elimination during
linking.  This method is not recommended and these relocations may be made
obsolete in a future revision of this specification.  These relocations may be
safely ignored.

Obsolete relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obsolete relocations are no-longer used in this revision of the specification
(but had defined meanings in a previous revision).  Unlike deprecated
relocations, there is no, or little known, use of these relocation codes.
Conforming object producers must not generate these relocation codes and
conforming linkers are not required to process them.  Future revisions of this
specification may re-assign these codes for a new relocation type.

Private relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relocation types 112-127 and 161-176 are reserved as platform-specific
relocations. The interpretation of these relocations is dependent on the value
of the :code:`EI_OSABI` field of the ELF header. If the value of
:code:`EI_OSABI` is zero or :code:`ELFOSABI_ARM_AEABI`, these relocations are

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

R_ARM_THM_BF16, R_ARM_THM_BF12 and R_ARM_THM_BF18 are used to relocate branch
targets for the Branch Future instructions in Armv8.1-M Mainline. The formation
of the initial addend in a REL type relocation for the various instruction
classes is described in `Armv8.1-M Mainline Branch Future relocation actions by
instruction type`_. The immediates mentioned in this table are the ones used to
represent the offset from the targetted branch instruction to the branch target
using a two's complement immediate. That is this immediate should be the same
as the one being used by the targetted branch instruction. Insn modification
describes how the result X is written back to the instruction; Result_Mask is
the value of X after the masking operation described in `Armv8.1-M Mainline
Branch Future relocations table`_ has been applied.

In all cases the following semantics apply:

* A Branch Future to an out of range label must either be replaced with a NOP
  or re-use an existing trampoline that jumps to the relocation target, it must
  not create a new trampoline. (It is up to the implementation to decide which
  of these options is preferable).
* No errors are required.

Unallocated relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All unallocated relocation types are reserved for use by future revisions of
this specification.

Idempotency
^^^^^^^^^^^

All RELA type relocations are idempotent.  They may be reapplied to the place
and the result will be the same.  This allows a static linker to preserve full
relocation information for an image by converting all REL type relocations into
RELA type relocations.

.. note::
   A REL type relocation can never be idempotent because the act of applying
   the relocation destroys the original addend.

Program Loading and Dynamic Linking
===================================

This section provides details of Arm-specific definitions and changes relating
to executable images.

Program Header
--------------

The Program Header provides a number of fields that assist in interpretation of
the file.  Most of these are specified in the base standard.  The following
fields have Arm-specific meanings.

.. rubric:: p_type

The following table lists the processor-specific segment types.

.. table:: Processor-specific segment types

  +-----------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------+
  | Name            | p_type     | Meaning                                         |

  +-----------------+------------+-------------------------------------------------+

A segment of type PT_ARM_ARCHEXT contains information describing the platform
capabilities required by the executable file.  The segment is optional, but if
present it must appear before segment of type PT_LOAD.  The platform
independent parts of this segment are described in `Platform architecture compatibility data`_.

PT_ARM_EXIDX (alias PT_ARM_UNWIND) describes the location of a program’s unwind
tables.

.. rubric:: p_flags

There are no processor-specific flags.  All bits in the PT_MASKPROC part of
this field are reserved to future revisions of this specification.

Platform architecture compatibility data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This data describes the platform capabilities required by an executable file.
It can be constructed by a linker using the attributes [Addenda32_] found in
its input relocatable files, or otherwise.

If this segment is present it shall contain at least one 32-bit word with
meaning defined by `Common architecture compatibility data masks`_,
`Architecture compatibility data formats`_, `Architecture profile compatibility
data`_, and `Architecture version compatibility data`_ below.

Platform architecture compatibility data (ABI format)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The status of this section is informative. It records a proposal that might be
adopted.

The data following the word defined by `Platform architecture compatibility data`_ consists of
an array of 2-byte signed integers (starting at offset 4 in the architecture
compatibility data segment) followed by a number of null-terminated byte
strings (NTBS). The p_filesz field of the segment header gives the total size
in bytes of the architecture compatibility data.

The integer array maps the ABI public attribute tags [Addenda32_] as follows.

* Array[0] contains the number of elements in array.

* If tag ≥ array[0], the value of tag for the executable file is 0.
  Only tags with non-0 values need to be mapped.

* If 4 ≤ tag < array[0], the value of tag for the executable file is
  array[tag]. A negative value v denotes that tag has the NTBS value found at
  offset –v from the start of the segment.

* Array[1] contains the major version number and array[2] the minor version
  number of the ABI release to which the data conforms (at least 2, 8).
  Array[3] is reserved and should be 0.

Program Loading
---------------

There are no processor-specific definitions relating to program loading.

Dynamic Linking
---------------

Dynamic Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following table lists the processor-specific dynamic array tags.

.. table:: AArch32-specific dynamic array tags

  +-------------------+------------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
  | Name              | Value      | d_un  | Executable        | Shared Object     |
  +===================+============+=======+===================+===================+
  | DT_ARM_RESERVED1  | 0x70000000 |       |                   |                   |
  +-------------------+------------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
  | DT_ARM_SYMTABSZ   | 0x70000001 | d_val | Platform specific | Platform specific |
  +-------------------+------------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
  | DT_ARM_PREEMPTMAP | 0x70000002 | d_ptr | Platform specific | Platform specific |
  +-------------------+------------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
  | DT_ARM_RESERVED2  | 0x70000003 |       |                   |                   |
  +-------------------+------------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+

DT_ARM_SYMTABSZ gives the number of entries in the dynamic symbol table,
including the initial dummy symbol.

DT_ARM_PREEMPTMAP holds the address of the pre-emption map for platforms that
use the DLL static binding model.  See `Symbol Pre-emption in DLLs`_ for details.
On platforms that permit use of a pre-emption map, the DT_SONAME tag must be
present in all shared objects.

.. note::
   Some executable images may exist that use DT_ARM_RESERVED1 and
   DT_ARM_RESERVED2 instead of DT_ARM_SYMTABSZ and DT_ARM_PREEMPTMAP
   respectively.  These tags use the d_un field in a manner incompatible with
   the Generic ELF requirements.

Post-Link Processing
--------------------

For some execution environments a further processing step may be needed after
linking before an executable can be run on the target environment.  The precise
processing may depend on both the target platform.  Depending on the nature of
the post-processing it may be done in any of following places

* As a final step during linking

* As a preliminary step during execution of the image

* As a separate post-linking step

In some cases the result may still be an ELF executable image, in others it may
produce an image that is in some other format more appropriate to the operating
system.

Production of BE-8 images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Images that are expected to execute in big-endian mode on processors that
implement Architecture version 6 or higher will normally need to be
post-processed to convert the instructions that are in big-endian byte order to
little-endian as expected by the processor.  The mapping symbol information can
be used to do this transformation accurately.  In all segments that contain
executable code:

* For areas mapped as data ($d or $d.<any…>) no changes are made

* For areas mapped as Thumb ($t or $t.<any…>) each half-word aligned pair of
  bytes are swapped

* For areas mapped as Arm ($a or $a.<any…>) each word-aligned object is swapped
  so that the first and fourth bytes are exchanged and the second and third
  exchanged.

An ELF image that has been transformed in this manner is marked by setting
EF_ARM_BE8 in the e_flags field.

.. note::
   If BE-8 images are subject to further relocation of instructions (either by
   a dynamic linker or by further post-linking operations) account must be
   taken of the fact that the instructions are now in little-endian format.

Appendix: Specimen Code for PLT Sequences
=========================================

The status of this appendix is informative.

DLL-like, single address space, PLT linkage
-------------------------------------------

The simplest code sequence for the PLT entry corresponding to imported symbol X
is:


.. code-block::

   LDR   ip, [pc, #0]         ; Load the 32-bit offset of my PLTGOT entry from SB
   LDR   pc, [ip, sb]!        ; Branch indirect through the PLTGOT entry
                              ;   leaving ip addressing the PLTGOT slot
   DCD   R_ARM_GOT_BREL(X)    ; GOT_BASE = SB

The final DCD is subject to relocation by a PLTGOT-generating relocation
directive. This directive may be processed by a target-specific linker or by a
target-specific post-linker. After processing:

* The place contains the 32-bit offset from the static base (sb) of the PLTGOT
  entry for X.

* The PLTGOT entry for X is subject to an R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT(X) dynamic
  relocation.

A more complicated sequence that avoids one of the memory accesses is:

.. code-block::

   ADD   ip, sb, #:SB_OFFSET_27_20:__PLTGOT(X)    ; R_ARM_ALU_SB_G0_NC(__PLTGOT(X))
   ADD   ip, ip, #:SB_OFFSET_19_12:__PLTGOT(X)    ; R_ARM_ALU_SB_G1_NC(__PLTGOT(X))
   LDR   pc, [ip, #:SB_OFFSET_11_0:__PLTGOT(X)]!  ; R_ARM_LDR_SB_G2(__PLTGOT(X))

If the linker can place all PLTGOT entries within 1MB of SB, the sequence
becomes:

.. code-block::

   ADD   ip, sb, #:SB_OFFSET_19_12:__PLTGOT(X)    ; R_ARM_ALU_SB_G0_NC(__PLTGOT(X))
   LDR   pc, [ip, #:SB_OFFSET_11_0:__PLTGOT(X)]!  ; R_ARM_LDR_SB_G1(__PLTGOT(X))

The write-back on the final LDR ensures that ip contains the address of the
PLTGOT entry. This is critical to incremental dynamic linking.

DLL-like, multiple virtual address space, PLT linkage
-----------------------------------------------------

The code sequence for the PLT entry corresponding to imported symbol X is:

.. code-block::

   LDR   ip, [pc, #0]      ; Load the 32-bit address of my PLTGOT entry
   LDR   pc, [ip]          ; Branch indirect through the PLTGOT entry
   DCD   R_ARM_GOT_ABS(X)  ; GOT_BASE = 0

Note that ip addresses the PLTGOT entry, which is critical to incremental
dynamic linking.

The final DCD is subject to relocation by a PLTGOT-generating relocation
directive. This directive may be processed by a target-specific linker or by a
target-specific post-linker. After processing:

* The place contains the 32-bit address of the PLTGOT entry for X.

* The PLTGOT entry for X is subject to an R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT(X) dynamic
  relocation.

Because a DLL has two segments that can be loaded independently, there is no
more efficient address generating sequence – analogous to the SB-relative
sequence shown in above –  that does not require complex instruction
field-relocating directives to be processed at dynamic link time.

This ABI requires dynamic relocations to relocate 32-bit fields, so there is no
sequence analogous to that of the preceding subsection.

SVr4 DSO-like PLT linkage
-------------------------

The simplest code sequence for the PLT entry corresponding to imported symbol X
is:

.. code-block::

        LDR   ip, L2         ; Load the 32-bit pc-relative offset of my PLTGOT entry
   L1:  ADD   ip, ip, pc     ; formulate its address...
        LDR   pc, [ip]       ; Branch through the PLTGOT entry addressed by ip
   L2:  DCD   R_ARM_GOT_PREL(X) + (L2 – L1 – 8)

The dynamic linker relies on ip addressing the PLTGOT entry for X.

The final DCD is subject to static relocation by a PLTGOT-generating relocation
directive. This directive may be processed by a target-specific linker or by a
target-specific post-linker. After processing:

* The place contains the 32-bit offset from L1+8 to the PLTGOT entry for X.

* The PLTGOT entry for X is subject to an R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT(X) dynamic
  relocation.

A more complicated, pc-relative, sequence that avoids one of the memory
accesses is shown below. Because an SVr4 executable file is compact (usually <
2\ :sup:`28` bytes) and rigid (it has only one base address, whereas a DLL has two), all
the relocations can be fully resolved during static linking.

.. code-block::

   ADD   ip, pc, #-8:PC_OFFSET_27_20: __PLTGOT(X)    ; R_ARM_ALU_PC_G0_NC(__PLTGOT(X))
   ADD   ip, ip, #-4:PC_OFFSET_19_12: __PLTGOT(X)    ; R_ARM_ALU_PC_G1_NC(__PLTGOT(X))
   LDR   pc, [ip, #0:PC_OFFSET_11_0: __PLTGOT(X)]!   ; R_ARM_LDR_PC_G2(__PLTGOT(X))

The write-back on the final LDR ensures that ip contains the address of the
PLTGOT entry. This is critical to incremental dynamic linking.

In effect, the sequence constructs a 28-bit offset for the LDR. The first
relocation does the right thing because pc addresses the LDR, so, in general,
it picks out bits [27-20] of that offset. The third relocation picks out bits
[11-0] of the same offset. The second relocation needs to construct bits
[19-12] of the offset from dot+4 to X., that is, from dot to X-4. Ignoring the
-4 sometimes produces the wrong answer!

Encoding such a small addend requires that the initial value not be shifted by
the shift applied to the result value. This is expected for a RELA-type
relocation that can encode -4 directly. However, a REL-type must encode the
initial value of the addend using SUB ip, ip, #4.

In small enough DSOs (< 2\ :sup:`20` bytes from the PLT to the PLTGOT) the first
instruction can be omitted, and the sequence collapses to the following.

.. code-block::

   SUB   ip, pc, #4:PC_OFFSET_19_12: __PLTGOT(X)    ; R_ARM_ALU_PC_G0_NC(__PLTGOT(X))
   LDR   pc, [ip, #0:PC_OFFSET_11_0: __PLTGOT(X)]!  ; R_ARM_LDR_PC_G2(__PLTGOT(X))

SVr4 executable-like PLT linkage
--------------------------------

An SVr4 executable does not need be position independent, its writable segment
can be relocated dynamically, and it is compact and rigid. Therefore, its PLT
entries can use the simple, absolute code sketched in `DLL-like, multiple virtual address space, PLT linkage`_
or the more complex, pc-relative, versions sketched in
`SVr4 DSO-like PLT linkage`_, as the tool chain chooses.

In both cases, ip must address the corresponding PLTGOT slot at the point where
the PLT calls through it.

Appendix: Conventions for symbols containing $
==============================================

The status of this appendix is informative.

A toolchain is not required to support any of the conventions described in this
appendix; however, it is recommended that if symbols matching the patterns
described are used, then the following conventions are adhered to.

Base, Length and Limit symbols
------------------------------

A number of symbols may be used to delimit the addresses and sizes of aspects
of a linked image.  These symbols are of the following general forms::

   Load$$region_name$$Base
   Image$$region_name$${Base|Length|Limit}
   Image$$region_name$$ZI$${Base|Length|Limit}
   Image$${RO|RW|ZI}$${Base|Limit}
   SectionName$${Base|Limit}

A toolchain may define these symbols unconditionally, or only if they are
referred to by the application: so a post-linker must not depend on the
existence of any of these symbols.

Sub-class and Super-class Symbols
---------------------------------

A symbol $Sub$$name is the sub-class version of name.  A symbol $Super$$name is
the super-class version of name.  In the presence of a definition of both name
and $Sub$$name:

* A reference to name resolves to the definition of $Sub$$name.

* A reference to $Super$$name resolves to the definition of name.

It is an error to refer to $Sub$$name, or to define $Super$$name, or to use
$Sub$$… or $Super$$… recursively.

Symbols for Veneering and Interworking Stubs
--------------------------------------------

A veneer symbol has the same binding as the symbol it veneers.  They are used
to label sequences of instructions that are automatically generated during
linking.  The general format of the symbols is::

   ${Ven|other}${AA|AT|TA|TT}${I|L|S}[$PI]$$symbol_name

where AA, AT, TA, or TT denotes the type of the veneer — Arm to Arm, Arm to
Thumb, etc; I, L, or S denotes inline (the target follows immediately), long
reach (32-bit), or short reach (typically 26-bit); and $PI denotes that the
veneer is position independent.
