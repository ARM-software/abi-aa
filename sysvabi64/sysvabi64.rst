Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution

About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the Licence_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

About this document
===================

Change Control
--------------

Current Status and Anticipated Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI specifications:

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

This document is at **Beta** release quality.

This document uses the following terms and abbreviations.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SysV
   Unix System V. A variant of the Unix Operating System. Although
   this specification refers to SysV, many other operating systems,
   such as Linux or BSD use similar conventions.

Platform
   A program execution environment such as that defined by an
   operating system or run- time environment. A platform defines the
   specific variant of the ABI and may impose additional
   constraints. Linux is a platform in this sense.

More specific terminology is defined when it is first used.

Scope
=====

Except where otherwise stated the AArch64 System V ABI follows the
AArch64 base ABI documents in ABIAA_ . The AArch64 System V ABI
documents the places where divergence exists with respect to the base
ABI and attempts to act as a unifying document to cover information in
a variety of places that is of relevance to a System V implementation.

Software Installation
=====================

This document does not specify how software must be installed on an
AArch64 system.

Low Level Information
=====================

TBD

Programming / Coding Examples
=============================

Architectural Considerations
----------------------------

The AArch64 architecture does not allow for instructions to encode
arbitrary 64 bit constants in a single instructions. Immediates or
constants need to be constructed by a sequence of instructions that
are defined in the Arm Architecture Reference Manual for AArch64
ARMARM_. Most instructions accept restricted immediate forms as
detailed in the ARMARM_, the details of which are beyond the scope of
this document. Given the range of immediates and offsets accepted by
various instructions, programming on this architecture lends itself to
a set of code models that define a set of constraints to allow an
efficient mapping of a program to a set of machine instructions. In
the following section we document the code sequences for memory
addressing; and in effect document the various memory models produced
for the architecture.

Absolute Addressing
-------------------

Absolute addressing means that the virtual addresses of instructions
and statically allocated data are known at static link time. To
execute properly the object must be loaded at the virtual address
specified by the static linker. Critically this means that the static
linker can embed these fixed, absolute addresses into the read-only,
shareable code, rather than requiring run-time relocation via a Global
Offset Table (GOT). Absolute addressing does not mean that PC-relative
addressing cannot be used, if that is the most efficient way to
generate an absolute address within the limits supported by the model.

Absolute addressing is suitable for most bare-metal code, including
the Linux kernel, as well as for normal GNU/Linux executables which –
while dynamically linked – are loaded at a fixed address.

Position independent addressing
-------------------------------

In position independent code (PIC) the virtual addresses of
instructions and static data are not known until dynamic link
time.

The PIC model depends on an offset, known at static link time between
a read-only dynamic relocation free executable segment and a
read-write segment containing dynamic relocations. Code in the
executable segment accesses data in the read-write segment via
PC-relative addressing modes. PIC is typically used when building
dynamic shared objects, where references to external variables must
use indirect references via a static linker created global offset
table (GOT).

A GOT generating relocation is used to inform the static
linker to create the GOT entry. The address of symbol definitions that
cannot be pre-empted at dynamic link time can have their address
taken so no GOT generating relocation is required.

PIC can also be used to build position independent executables. A
variant of PIC called PIE (position independent executable) can be
used to build an executable. PIE assumes that global symbols cannot be
pre-empted, which means that an indirection via the GOT is not needed.

Assembler language addressing mode conventions
----------------------------------------------

The assembler examples in this document make use of operators to
modify the addressing mode used to form the immediate value of the
instruction.

The tables below describe the assembler operators that can be used to
alter the relocation directive emitted by the assembler. The typical
syntax is of the form ``#:<operator>:<symbol name>``

   The symbol``__GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__`` refers to the start of the
   global offset table (GOT) in the ELF module. The assembler
   instruction ``adrp xn, __GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__`` finds the address of the 4KiB page
   containing the start of the GOT.

   ``#:gotpage_lo15:src`` is a 15-bit offset into the page containing
   the GOT entry for ``src``.

   ``#:gotoff_lo15:src`` - This refers to the 15 bit offset from the
   start of the GOT.

Code Models
===========

The AArch64 A64 instruction set has a number of features and
constraints which make it desirable to use different code models for
different sizes of executable or dynamic shared object, to improve
performance and reduce static code size. The relevant constraints are:

* The LDR (literal) and ADR instructions generate a PC-relative address
  with a range of +/- 1MiB.

* The ADRP instruction generates a PC-relative, page aligned address
  with a range of +/- 4GiB (where page = 4KiB).

* The LDR and STR instructions accept a 12-bit unsigned immediate
  offset, scaled by the access size.

* The B and BL instructiond have a range of +/-128MiB. This is
  typically used for function / procedure calls.

* A series of MOVZ and up to 3 MOVK instructions can be used to
  construct a 64-bit value

* Static linkers may insert a veneer (a sequence of instructions) to
  implement a relocated B or BL to a destination further away than the
  +/-128MiB range. The size of executable sections must be limited to
  127 MiB to leave space for veneers to be inserted after the section.

* The relative data relocations R_AARCH64_PLT32 and R_AARCH64_PREL32
  have a range of +/-2GiB.

The code models assume that an executable or shared library use an ELF
file layout similar to the diagram below.

.. _Illustrative ELF file layout:

.. rubric:: Illustrative ELF file layout

.. figure:: sysvabi64-elf-layout.svg

The table below identifies the code models that have been defined,
along with the assumptions that the code model may make.

  |       |                |                | PIC: none              |
  +-------+----------------+----------------+------------------------+
  | large | 2GiB           | no restriction | pic: got size < 32 KiB |
  |       |                |                +------------------------+

  |       |                |                | text to GOT < 4 GiB    |
  +-------+----------------+----------------+------------------------+

.. note::

  1. The max segment size columns describes the total span of the
  statically allocated content. It says nothing about the base address
  of the program or shared object, which may be located anywhere
  within the AArch64 virtual address space.

  2. The definition of the text segment includes the shareable PLT,
  code and read-only data sections. If the components of text segment
  are in separate consecutive ELF segments then the text segment is
  the maximum combined span of the ELF segments.

  3. The data segment contains the statically defined, writeable,
  per-process data sections. In all models dynamically allocated data
  and stack can make use of the full virtual address space, dependent
  on operating system addressing limits. If the components are in
  separate ELF segments, the data segment is the maximum combined span
  of the ELF segments.

  4. The code models assume the text and data segments are consecutive
  in virtual memory with only padding for segment alignment between
  them. Programs that have significant separation between the code and
  data segments must take this extra distance into account in the max
  combined span of text and data segments.

  5. The text segment maximum size is limited to 2GiB by
  R_AARCH64_PLT32 relocations from .ehframe sections.

  6. While designing the code models it was estimated that only 2.6%
  of load modules (executables and dynamic shared objects) have a max
  text segment size greater than 1MiB; the rest would all fit into the
  tiny model. However to avoid build option changes, it is recommended
  that the small model should be the default, with an explicit option
  to select the tiny model.

  7. Executables and shared objects may be linked dynamically with other
  shared objects which use a different code model.

  8. Linking of relocatable objects of different code models is possible
  as is linking of PIC/PIE and non-PIC relocatable objects. The result
  of the combination is always the most limited model. For example the
  combination of a tiny code model PIC object and small code model
  non-PIC object is a tiny non-PIC executable.

  9. The large code model is aimed at programs with large amounts of
  read-write data, not large amounts or sparsely placed code.

Implementation of code models
-----------------------------

The convention for command-line option to select code model is
``-mcmodel=<model>`` where code model is one of small, medium or
large.

The convention for command-line option to select position-independent
code is ``-fpic`` for pic ``-fPIC`` for PIC. When compiling for an
executable ``-fpie`` and ``-fPIE`` have the same GOT size limitations
as ``-fpic`` and ``-fPIC`` respectively.

Not all compilers will implement all of the code models. The table
below describes the implementation status of code models for two
open-source compilers.

Sample code sequences for code models
-------------------------------------

The following section provide some sample code sequences for
addressing static data. The samples are provided to illustrate the
effects on code-generation of the code-models.

Get the address of a symbol defined in the same ELF file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code that is not position independent may use the absolute address of
the symbol. Code that is position independent may use a pc-relative
offset to the symbol if the definition of the symbol is not
pre-emptible. If the symbol is pre-emptible the address must be loaded
from the GOT.

PC-relative offset of +/- 1 MiB. Suitable for tiny code model.

.. code-block:: asm

    adr x0, var

PC-relative offset of +/- 4 GiB. Suitable for small code model.

.. code-block:: asm

    adrp x0, var
    add x0, x0, #:lo12: var

Absolute load of a literal, where the literal is within 1
MiB. Suitable for large code model if the literal is defined within
the same section as the code.

.. code-block:: asm

    ldr x0, .L0
  .L0
    .xword var

Absolute using a load of a literal where the literal is within 4
GiB. Suitable for the large code model.

.. code-block:: asm

    adrp x0, .L0
    ldr x0, [x0, #:lo12: .L0]
  .L0
    .xword var

Absolute using 4 instructions. Suitable for the large code model.

.. code-block:: asm

    movz    x0, # :abs_g0_nc: var
    movk    x1, # :abs_g1_nc: var
    movk    x2, # :abs_g2_nc: var
    movk    x3, # :abs_g3: var

Get the value of a symbol defined in the same ELF file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the general case one of the sequences above is used to get the
address. A load instruction can then be used to obtain the value. In
some cases the add can be folded into the load.

PC-relative offset of +/- 4 GiB. Suitable for the small code model.

.. code-block:: asm

    adrp x0, var
    ldr x0, [x0, #:lo12:var]


Get the address of a symbol from the GOT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GOT is a linker generated table of addresses. Every address in the
GOT is at least 8 byte aligned and the base of the GOT can be obtained
by the linker defined ``__GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__`` symbol.

All of GOT is within 1 MiB

.. code-block:: asm

    ldr x0, :got: var

Base of GOT is within 4 GiB, GOT size is < 32 KiB. Suitable for pic.

.. code-block:: asm

    adrp x0, :got: __GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__
    ldr x0, [x0, # :gotpage_lo15: var]

All of GOT is within 4 GiB, GOT size is >= 32 KiB. Suitable for PIC.

.. code-block:: asm

    adrp x0, :got: var
    ldr x0, [x0, # :got_lo12: var]

Get the address of a weak reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An undefined weak reference resolves to 0. In the general case it is
not possible to give an offset that when added to the PC will result
in 0. To get the address of a weak reference the compiler can use a
load from literal or acccess the address via a GOT entry, which will
evaluate to 0 if the symbol is undefined.
