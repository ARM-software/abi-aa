Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You
under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the Licence_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

Contributions
-------------

Contributions to this project are licensed under an inbound=outbound
model such that any such contributions are licensed by the contributor
under the same terms as those in the `Licence`_ section.

About this document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI specifications:

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

All content in this document is at the **Release** quality level.

Terms and abbreviations
-----------------------

The *ABI for the Arm Architecture* uses the following terms and
abbreviations.

AAPCS
   Procedure Call Standard for the Arm Architecture.

ABI
   Application Binary Interface:

   1. The specifications to which an executable must conform in order to
      execute in a specific execution environment. For example, the
      :title-reference:`Linux ABI for the Arm Architecture`.

   2. A particular aspect of the specifications to which independently
      produced relocatable files must conform in order to be statically
      linkable and executable. For example, the C++ ABI for the Arm
      Architecture [CPPABI32_], the Run-time ABI for the Arm Architecture
      [RTABI32_], the C Library ABI for the Arm Architecture [CLIBABI32_].

AEABI
   (Embedded) ABI for the Arm architecture (this ABI...)

Arm-based
   ... based on the Arm architecture ...

core registers
   The general purpose registers visible in the Arm architecture’s
   programmer’s model, typically r0-r12, SP, LR, PC, and CPSR.

EABI
   An ABI suited to the needs of embedded, and deeply embedded (sometimes
   called free standing), applications.

Q-o-I
   Quality of Implementation – a quality, behavior, functionality, or
   mechanism not required by this standard, but which might be provided
   by systems conforming to it.  Q-o-I is often used to describe the
   tool-chain-specific means by which a standard requirement is met.

VFP
   The Arm architecture’s Floating Point architecture and instruction
   set.  In this ABI, this abbreviation includes all floating point
   variants regardless of whether or not vector (V) mode is supported.

Overview
========

The C++ ABI for the Arm architecture (CPPABI) comprises four
sub-components.

-  The generic C++ ABI, summarized in `The Generic C++ ABI`_, is the referenced base
   standard for this component.

-  The *C++ ABI supplement* in `Summary of differences from and
   additions to the generic C++ ABI`_ details Arm-specific additions
   to and deviations from the generic standard.

-  The separately documented *Exception Handling ABI for the Arm
   Architecture* [EHABI32_], summarized in `The Exception handling ABI
   for the Arm architecture`_, describes the language-independent and
   C++-specific aspects of exception handling.

-  The example implementations of the exception handling components
   [EHEGI], summarized in `The exception handling components example
   implementation`_, include:

  - A language independent unwinder.

  - A C++ semantics module.

  - Arm-specific C++ unwinding personality routines.

The generic C++ ABI is implicitly an SVr4-based standard, and takes an
SVr4 position on symbol visibility and vague linkage. The *C++ ABI
supplement* in `The C++ ABI supplement`_ details extensions for
DLL-based environments.

The Generic C++ ABI
-------------------

The generic C++ ABI [GCPPABI_] (originally developed for SVr4 on Itanium)
specifies:

-  The layout of C++ non-POD class types in terms of the layout of POD
   types (specified for *this* ABI by the *Procedure Call Standard for
   the Arm Architecture* [AAPCS32_]).

-  How class types requiring copy construction are passed as parameters
   and results.

-  The content of run-time type information (RTTI).

-  Necessary APIs for object construction and destruction.

-  How names with linkage are mangled (name mangling).

The generic C++ ABI refers to a separate Itanium-specific specification
of exception handling. When the generic C++ ABI is used as a component
of *this* ABI, corresponding reference must be made to the *Exception
Handling ABI for the Arm Architecture* [EHABI32_] and `The Exception
handling ABI for the Arm architecture`_.

The Exception handling ABI for the Arm architecture
---------------------------------------------------

In common with the Itanium exception handling ABI, the *Exception
handling ABI for the Arm architecture* [EHABI32_] specifies table-based
unwinding that separates language-independent unwinding from language
specific aspects. The specification describes:

-  The *base class* format and meaning of the tables understood by the
   language-independent exception handling system, and their
   representation in relocatable files. The language-independent
   exception handler only uses fields from the base class.

-  A *derived table class* used by Arm tools that efficiently encodes
   stack-unwinding instructions and compactly represents the data needed
   for handling C++ exceptions.

-  The interface between the language independent exception handling
   system and the *personality routines* specific to a particular
   implementation for a particular language. Personality routines
   interpret the language-specific, derived class tables. Conceptually
   (though not literally, for reasons of implementation convenience and
   run-time efficiency), personality routines are member functions of
   the derived class.

-  The interfaces between the (C++) language exception handling
   semantics module and:

  - The language-independent exception handling system.

  - The personality routines.

  - The (C++) application code (effectively the interface underlying
    *throw*).

The EHABI contains a significant amount of commentary to aid and support
independent implementation of:

-  Personality routines.

-  The language-specific exception handling semantics module.

-  Language-independent exception handling.

This commentary does not provide, and is not intended to provide,
complete specifications of independent implementations, but it does give
a rationale for the interfaces to, and among, these components.

The exception handling components example implementation
--------------------------------------------------------

The exception handling components example implementation (EHEGI)
comprises the following files.

-  **cppsemantics.cpp** is a module that implements the semantics of C++
   exception handling. It uses the language-independent unwinder
   (unwinder.c), and is used by the Arm-specific personality routines
   (unwind\_pr.[ch]).

-  **cxxabi.h** describes the generic C++ ABI (`The Generic C++ ABI`_).

-  **Licence.txt** describes your licence to use the exception handling
   example implementation.

-  **unwind\_env.h** is a header that describes the build and execution
   environments of the exception handling components. This header must
   be edited if the exception handling components are to be built with
   non-Arm compilers. This header #includes cxxabi.h.

-  **unwind\_pr.c** implements the three Arm-specific personality
   routines described in the *Exception Handling ABI for the Arm
   Architecture*.

-  **unwinder.c** is an implementation of the language-independent
   unwinder.

-  **unwinder.h** describes the interface to the language-independent
   unwinder, as described in the *Exception Handling ABI for the Arm
   Architecture*.

======================

Summary of differences from and additions to the generic C++ ABI
----------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes the differences between the *C++ ABI for the Arm
architecture* and the generic C++ ABI. Section numbers in captions refer
to the generic C++ ABI specification. Larger differences are detailed in
subsections of `Differences in detail`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 1.2_ **Limits**

The offset of a non-virtual base sub-object in the full object
containing it must fit into a 24-bit signed integer (because of RTTI
implementation). This implies a practical limit of 2\ :sup:`23` bytes on
the size of a class sub-object.

**GC++ABI §**\ 2.2_ **POD Data Types**

The GC++ABI defines the way in which empty class types are laid out. For
the purposes of parameter passing in AAPCS32_, a parameter whose type is
an empty class shall be treated as if its type were an aggregate with a
single member of type unsigned byte.

.. note::
  
  Of course, the single member has undefined content.

**GC++ABI §**\ 2.3_ **Member Pointers**

The pointer to member function representation differs from that used by
Itanium. See `Representation of pointer to member function`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 2.7_ **Array operator new cookies**

Array cookies, when present, are always 8 bytes long and contain both
element size and element count (in that order). See `Array construction and destruction`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 2.8_ **Initialization guard variables**

Static initialization guard variables are 4 bytes long not 8, and there
is a different protocol for using them which allows a guard variable to
implement a semaphore when used as the target of Arm SWP or LDREX and
STREX instructions. See `Guard variables and the one-time construction API`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 2.9.1_ **Run-Time Type Information (RTTI), General**

The target platform ABI specifies whether address equality is required
for type\_info objects that describe the same type. (The ABI-defined
symbol names for type\_info objects and their names match the pattern
\_ZT{I,S}\*). A C++ system that supports a platform must follow the
platform’s specification. The GC++ABI gives the correct specification
for SVr4-based platforms such as Linux.

A C++ system must provide implementations of
``std::type_info::operator==``, ``std::type_info::operator!=``, and ``(const
std::type_info&)::before`` appropriate to the target platform.

These std::type\_info functions should not be inline by default, as
doing so makes the relocatable file platform-specific. A C++ system must
provide an option or default (Q-o-I) to force them out of line.

**GC++ABI §**\ 3.1.5_ **Constructor return values**

This ABI requires C1 and C2 constructors to return *this* (instead of
being void functions) so that a C3 constructor can tail call the C1
constructor and the C1 constructor can tail call C2.

Similarly, we require D2 and D1 to return *this* so that D0 need not
save and restore *this* and D1 can tail call D2 (if there are no virtual
bases). D0 is still a void function.

We do not require thunks to virtual destructors to return *this*. Such a
thunk would have to adjust the destructor’s result, preventing it from
tail calling the destructor, and nullifying any possible saving.

Consequently, only non-virtual calls of D1 and D2 destructors can be
relied on to return *this*.

**GC++ABI §**\ 3.3.2_ **One-time construction API**

The type of parameters to \_\_cxa\_guard\_acquire,
\_\_cxa\_guard\_release and \_\_cxa\_guard\_abort is 'int\*' (not
'\_\_int64\_t\*'), and use of fields in the guard variable differs. See
`Guard variables and the one-time construction API`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 3.3.4_ **Controlling Object Construction Order**

#pragma priority is not supported. See `Top-level static object construction`_ for details of how
global object construction is coordinated.

**GC++ABI §**\ 3.3.5.3_ **Runtime API**

This ABI defines \_\_aeabi\_atexit (`Code example for \_\_aeabi\_atexit`_ and \_\_aeabi\_atexit), for
use in place of \_\_cxa\_atexit.

It is forbidden for user code to call \_\_cxa\_atexit or
\_\_aeabi\_atexit directly, or for any call to \_\_aeabi\_atexit (other
than ones from the implementations of the atexit library functions) to
be executed more than once (`Static object destruction`_).

**GC++ABI §**\ 3.4_ **Demangler API**

The demangler is not provided as a library.

**GC++ABI §**\ 5.1.5_ **Builtin Types**

The ``__bf16`` is mangled as ``u6__bf16``.

**GC++ABI §**\ 5.2.2_ **Static Data (new in ABI r2.06)**

If a static datum and its guard variable are emitted in the same COMDAT
group, the ELF binding [GELF_] for both symbols must be STB\_GLOBAL, not
STB\_WEAK as specified in GCPPABI_. `ELF binding of static data guard
variable symbols`_ justifies this requirement.

**GC++ABI §**\ 5.2.3_ **Virtual Tables and the key function**

A compiler selects the key function for a class T when it has read the
entire translation unit containing the definition of T. The key function
is the textually first, non-inline, non-pure, virtual, member function
of T.

An inline member is not a key function even if it is the first declared
inline at the completion of the class definition.

(In contrast, the GC++ABI §\ 5.2.3_ 
defines the key function to be the textually first, non-inline,
non-pure, virtual function identified at completion of the class
definition).

In the following example, the key function is T::f.

.. code-block:: c++

    struct T {
    inline virtual void a();      // inline
           virtual void b();      // might be defined inline later...
           virtual void c() { }   // implicitly inline
           virtual void d() = 0;  // pure
                   void e();      // not virtual...
           virtual void f(), g(); 
    };
    inline void T::b() { }          // but b is defined to be inline
  // End of translation unit... The key function is 'T::f'; GC++ABI chooses T::b;


**GC++ABI §**\ 5.3_ **Unwind Table Location**

See section 'The top-level exception handling architecture' of *Exception
Handling ABI for the Arm Architecture* [EHABI32_].

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI – a library nothrow new function must
not examine its 2**:sup:`nd` **argument)**

Library versions of the following functions *must not* examine their
second argument.

.. code-block:: c++

  ::operator new(std::size_t, const std::nothrow_t&)
  ::operator new[](std::size_t, const std::nothrow_t&)


(The second argument conveys no useful information other than through
its presence or absence, which is manifest in the mangling of the name
of the function. This ABI therefore allows code generators to use a
potentially invalid second argument – for example, whatever value
happens to be in R1 – at a point of call).

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI – library placement new functions
must be inline)**

We require the library placement allocation functions (§18.4.1.3 of ISO
C++) to be inline with these definitions:

.. code-block:: c++

  inline void *operator new(std::size_t, void* __ptr) throw() { return __ptr; }
  inline void *operator new[](std::size_t, void* __ptr) throw() { return __ptr; }

We do not require the library placement deallocation functions to be
inline:

.. code-block:: c++

  void operator delete(void*, void*) throw();
  void operator delete[](void*, void*) throw();

(They can only be called via exceptions thrown by failing constructors
or directly by user code).

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI, but would be
§**\ 2.2_ **POD data types)**

Pointers to extern "C++" functions and pointers to extern "C" functions
are interchangeable if the function types are otherwise identical.

In order to be used by the library helper functions described below,
implementations of constructor and destructor functions (complete,
sub-object, and allocating) must have a type compatible with:

.. code-block:: c++

   extern "C" void* (*)(void* /* , other argument types if any */);

Deleting destructors must have a type compatible with:

.. code-block:: c++

   extern "C" void (*)(void*);

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI, but would be
§**\ 3.3.4_ **Controlling Object Construction Order)**

Global object construction and destruction are managed in a simplified
way under this ABI (see `Static object construction and destruction`_).

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI – DLL symbol visibility and linkage
issues)**

`Inter-DLL symbol visibility and linkage`_ discusses inter-DLL symbol visibility and linkage issues.

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI – Namespace and mangling for the
va\_list type) (new in r2.07)**

The type \_\_va\_list is in namespace std. The type name of va\_list
therefore mangles to St9\_\_va\_list.

Differences in detail
---------------------

Representation of pointer to member function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The generic C++ ABI [GCPPABI_] specifies that a pointer to member
function is a pair of words <*ptr*, *adj*>. The least significant bit of
*ptr* discriminates between (0) the address of a non-virtual member
function and (1) the offset in the class’s virtual table of the address
of a virtual function.

This encoding cannot work for the Arm-Thumb instruction set where code
addresses use all 32 bits of *ptr*.

This ABI specifies that *adj* contains twice the *this* adjustment, plus
1 if the member function is virtual. The least significant bit of *adj*
then makes exactly the same discrimination as the least significant bit
of *ptr* does for Itanium.

A pointer to member function is NULL when *ptr* = 0 *and* the least
significant bit of *adj* is zero.

Array construction and destruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Array cookies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An array cookie is used for heap-allocated arrays of objects with class
type where the class has a destructor or the class's *usual (array)
deallocation function* [ISO C++ §3.7.3.2] has two arguments, i.e.
``T::operator delete(void*, std::size_t)``. Nonetheless, an array cookie
is not used if ``::operator new[](std::size_t, void*)`` is used for the
allocation as the user is then responsible for the deallocation and the
associated bookkeeping.

When a cookie is needed this ABI always specifies the same cookie type:

.. code-block:: c++

     struct array_cookie {
         std::size_t element_size; // element_size != 0 
         std::size_t element_count; 
     };

This is different than the generic C++ ABI which uses a variable sized
cookie depending on the alignment of element type of the array being
allocated.

.. note::

  Although it's not a particularly useful property, this cookie is
  usable as a generic C++ cookie when the generic C++ cookie size is 8
  bytes.

Both the element size and element count are recorded in the cookie. For
example, in the following the element size would be sizeof(S) = 8 and
the element count would be 3 \* 5 = 15.

.. code-block:: c++

  struct S { int a[2]; };
  typedef SA S[3]; 
  S* s = new SA[5];

.. note::

  The element size can never legally be zero. Finding a zero element
  size at delete [ ] time indicates heap corruption.

Array cookie alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The array cookie is allocated at an 8-byte aligned address immediately
preceding the user's array. Since the cookie size is 8 bytes the user's
array is also 8-byte aligned.

Library helper functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generic C++ ABI contains some helper functions for array
construction and destruction:

.. code-block::

  __cxa_vec_new     __cxa_vec_new2 
  __cxa_vec_new3    __cxa_vec_ctor
  __cxa_vec_dtor    __cxa_vec_cleanup
  __cxa_vec_delete  __cxa_vec_delete2
  __cxa_vec_delete3 __cxa_vec_cctor

Compilers are not required to use these helper functions but runtime
libraries must supply them and they must work with the always 8-byte
cookies. These functions take pointers to constructors or destructors.
Since constructors and destructors conforming to this ABI return *this*
(`Summary of differences from and additions to the generic C++ ABI`_, ¶§3.1.5 *Constructor return values*, above) the return types of
these parameters are void\* instead of void.

The generic C++ ABI gives \_\_cxa\_vec\_ctor and \_\_cxa\_vec\_cctor a
void return type. This ABI specifies void\* instead. The value returned
is the same as the first parameter – a pointer to the array being
constructed. We do not change the return type for \_\_cxa\_vec\_dtor
because we provide \_\_aeabi\_vec\_dtor which has the additional
advantage of not taking a padding\_size parameter.

In addition, we define the following new helpers which can be called
more efficiently.

.. code-block::

      __aeabi_vec_ctor_nocookie_nodtor
      __aeabi_vec_ctor_cookie_nodtor
      __aeabi_vec_cctor_nocookie_nodtor
      __aeabi_vec_new_cookie_noctor
      __aeabi_vec_new_nocookie
      __aeabi_vec_new_cookie_nodtor
      __aeabi_vec_new_cookie
      __aeabi_vec_dtor
      __aeabi_vec_dtor_cookie
      __aeabi_vec_delete
      __aeabi_vec_delete3
      __aeabi_vec_delete3_nodtor
      __aeabi_atexit

Again, compilers are not required to use these functions but runtime
libraries must supply them.

\_\_aeabi\_vec\_dtor effectively makes \_\_cxa\_vec\_dtor obsolete.

Compilers are encouraged to use the \_\_aeabi\_vec\_dtor instead of
\_\_cxa\_vec\_dtor and \_\_aeabi\_vec\_delete instead of
\_\_cxa\_vec\_delete. Run-time environments are encouraged to expect
this, perhaps implementing \_\_cxa\_vec\_delete in terms of
\_\_aeabi\_vec\_delete instead of the other way around.

We define \_\_aeabi\_vec\_delete3 but not a corresponding
\_\_aeabi\_vec\_delete2. Using that would be less efficient than using
\_\_aeabi\_vec\_dtor and calling the ``T1::operator delete[]`` directly. See
note 3 on page 18, below.

\_\_cxa\_vec\_ctor still has uses not covered by
\_\_aeabi\_vec\_ctor\_nocookie\_nodtor and
\_\_aeabi\_vec\_ctor\_cookie\_nodtor.

Additional helpers for array construction (i.e. new T[n],
\_\_aeabi\_vec\_new\_\*) may be added in future releases of this ABI.

Definitions of the \_\_aeabi\_\* functions are given below in terms of
example implementations. It is not required to implement them this way.

Code examples for the delete expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Section 5.3.5 of the ISO C++ standard discusses the delete expression.

The code needed to implement ``delete [] p`` is tabulated in `Implementation of
delete [] p`_, below. It depends on:

-  The static element type of p (referred to as T below),

-  Which ``operator delete []`` is being used for this de-allocation: either
   ``::operator delete(void*)`` or ``T1::operator delete(void*)``, where T1 is
   T or a base class of T.

-  Whether a cookie is needed for arrays of T (see `Array cookies`_).

-  *Has dtor*, which means T is a class type with a non-trivial
   destructor [ISO C++ §12.4]. In cases where there is no cookie there
   must be no dtor.

.. note::

  1. Other operator delete[]s, such as. operator delete[](void\*, const
     std::nothrow&) or operator delete[](void\*, void\*), can be called
     explicitly by a user, but can only be called implicitly when a new
     array expression throws an exception during allocation or
     construction.
  
  2. This is an unusual case that can only be reached by using ``::delete[]``,
     for example:

     .. code-block:: c++
  
        struct T { static void operator delete(void*, std::size_t); } *p;
        ::delete[] p;
  
  3. ``__aeabi_vec_delete3_nodtor(p, &T1::operator delete[])`` could also
     be done this way:
  
     .. code-block:: c++
  
        T1::operator delete[](&cookie_of(p), sizeof(T)*element_count_of(p))
  
  4. ``__aeabi_vec_delete3(p, &T::~T{D1}, &T1::operator delete[])`` could
     also be done this way:
  
     .. code-block:: c++
  
        T1::operator delete[]
            (__aeabi_vec_dtor_cookie(p, &T::~T{D1}), sizeof(T)*element_count_of(p))

Code example for \_\_aeabi\_atexit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because constructors conforming to this ABI return *this*, construction
of a top-level static object and the registration of its destructor can
be done as:

.. code-block:: c++
  
   __aeabi_atexit(T::T{C1}(&t), &T::~T{D1}, &__dso_handle);

This saves an instruction compared with calling \_\_cxa\_atexit
directly, and allows a smart linker to calculate how much space to
allocate statically to registering top-level object destructions
(`Static object destruction`_).

Guard variables and the one-time construction API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Guard variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support the potential use of initialization guard variables as
semaphores that are the target of Arm SWP and LDREX/STREX synchronizing
instructions we define a static initialization guard variable to be a
4-byte aligned, 4-byte word with the following inline access protocol.

.. code-block:: c++

  #define INITIALIZED 1
  // inline guard test…
  if ((obj_guard & INITIALIZED)!= INITIALIZED) {
      // TST obj_guard, #1; BNE already_initialized
      if (__cxa_guard_acquire(&obj_guard)) {
          ...
  }

Usually, a guard variable should be allocated in the same data section
as the object whose construction it guards.

One-time construction API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ``extern "C" int __cxa_guard_acquire(int *guard_object);``

If the guarded object has not yet been initialized, this function
returns 1. Otherwise it returns 0.

If it returns 1, a semaphore might have been claimed and associated with
*guard\_object*, and either \_\_cxa\_guard\_release or
\_\_cxa\_guard\_abort must be called with the same argument to release
the semaphore.

    ``extern "C" void __cxa_guard_release(int *guard_object);``

This function is called on completing the initialization of the guarded
object. It sets the least significant bit of *guard\_object* (allowing
subsequent inline checks to succeed) and releases any semaphore
associated with it.

    ``extern "C" void __cxa_guard_abort(int *guard_object);``

This function is called if any part of the initialization of the guarded
object terminates by throwing an exception. It releases any semaphore
associated with *guard\_object*.

Static object construction and destruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Top-level static object construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The compiler is responsible for sequencing the construction of top-level
static objects defined in a translation unit in accordance with the
requirements of the C++ standard. The run-time environment
(helper-function library) sequences the initialization of one
translation unit after another. The global *constructor vector* provides
the interface between these agents as follows.

-  Each translation unit provides a fragment of the constructor vector
   in an ELF section called .init\_array of type SHT\_INIT\_ARRAY (=0xE)
   and section flags SHF\_ALLOC + SHF\_WRITE.

-  Each element of the vector contains the address of a function of type
   extern “C” void (\* const)(void) that, when called, performs part or
   all of the global object construction for the translation unit.
   Producers must treat .init\_array sections *as if* they were
   read-only.

   The appropriate entry for an element referring to, say,
   \_\_sti\_\ *file* that constructs the global static objects in
   *file*\ cpp, is 0 relocated by R\_ARM\_ TARGET1(\_\_sti\_\ *file*).
   Usually, R\_ARM\_ TARGET1 is interpreted by a static linker as
   R\_ARM\_ABS32 (for details, see the [Note] below).

-  Run-time support code iterates through the global constructor vector
   in increasing address order calling each identified initialization
   function in order. This ABI does not specify a way to control the
   order in which translation units are initialized.

.. note::

   In some execution environments, constructor vector entries contain
   self-relative references, which cost an additional ADD in the library
   code that traverses the vector, but save dynamic relocations, giving
   a smaller executable size and faster start-up when an executable must
   be dynamically linked and relocated. In these environments, a static
   linker interprets R\_ARM\_TARGET1 as R\_ARM\_REL32 rather than as
   R\_ARM\_ABS32. In some execution environments, constructor vector
   entries will be allocated to a read-only execution segment.

Static object destruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sequencing of static object destruction in C++ requires destructions to be
registered dynamically in the order of object construction (`Code example for
\_\_aeabi\_atexit`_), correctly interleaved with any calls to the *atexit*
library function(s).

This ABI requires static object destruction to be registered by calling
\_\_aeabi\_atexit (`Code example for \_\_aeabi\_atexit`_ and [\_\_aeabi\_atexit]).

Implementations of the generic C++ ABI helper function \_\_cxa\_atexit
usually allocate elements of the list of static objects to be destroyed
dynamically, but some execution environments require static allocation.
To support allocating this list statically, compilers must ensure that:

-  Static object destructions are registered using \_\_aeabi\_atexit,
   *not* \_\_cxa\_atexit.

-  Each call to \_\_aeabi\_atexit registers the destruction of the data objects
   constructed by the calling code. (Thus each static call will be executed at
   most once, and table-driven registration of several destructions by a single
   static call to \_\_aeabi\_atexit is forbidden).

The maximum number of destructions that can be registered by a
relocatable file is then the number of sites calling \_\_aeabi\_atexit.
A smart linker can count the number of sites and allocate space for the
list accordingly.

The maximum number of calls to \_\_aeabi\_atexit on behalf of the
*atexit* library functions is bounded by the implementation definition.
The C++ standard requires at least 32 calls to be supported.

It is Q-o-I whether a linker and matching run-time library can allocate
the list statically. So is the behaviour if the library calls
\_\_aeabi\_atexit (e.g. on behalf of *atexit*) more times than a static
allocation supports.

Inter-DLL symbol visibility and linkage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Strictly, only subsection `Inter-DLL visibility rules for C++ ABI-defined
symbols`_ of this section contributes to this ABI. Subsections `Background`_,
`Symbol visibility, DLL export, and DLL import`_, `Symbol visibility for C++
entities`_, `Vague linkage`_, and `One definition rule considerations in the
absence of dynamic vague linkage`_ give background, terminology, and rationale,
but do not form part of this standard.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

An SVr4 (Unix or Linux) dynamic shared object (DSO) is best thought of
as a library, rather than a module with a controlled interface. By
default, every global symbol defined in a DSO is visible to its clients.
When a program is linked dynamically with a DSO, the linkage semantics
are the same as when it is linked statically with the corresponding
static library. (We ignore here DSOs loaded dynamically by dlopen(), for
which there is no static counterpart). In this environment the C++ ABI
need not be aware of the existence of DSOs, and, indeed, the generic C++
ABI hardly mentions them.

In contrast, a dynamic link library (DLL) is much more a module with a
controlled interface. Historically, the visibility of symbols between
DLLs has been controlled explicitly using import and export directives
to the static linker or source code annotations such as the
\_\_declspec(dllexport) and \_\_declspec(dllimport) familiar to
Microsoft Windows developers. By default, global symbols defined in a
DLL are invisible outside of it.

In C, there is a one to one correspondence between source entities with
external linkage and global symbols. There are no implicit global
symbols other than compiler helper functions. It is, therefore,
tractable to control visibility explicitly (using a variety of Q-o-I
mechanisms).

In C++ there are several implicit entities associated with classes
(v-tables, RTTI, etc) that have corresponding C++ ABI-specified global
symbols, but there is no simple, universally accepted model of
controlling their visibility between DLLs. This ABI specifies a simple
binary interface that promotes inter-operation between independently
compiled relocatable files while remaining faithful to the DLL-based
expectation of explicit visibility control.

A further complication is that, at the time of writing, not all DLL-based
execution environments encompassed by the *ABI for the Arm Architecture* are
capable of resolving vague linkage (`Vague linkage`_) dynamically. This means
that they cannot always provide a single address for entities required to have
a single definition (`One definition rule considerations in the absence of
dynamic vague linkage`_).

Symbol visibility, DLL export, and DLL import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the binary interface, the scope of an ELF global symbol is restricted
by giving it a non default visibility attribute. Specifically,
STV\_HIDDEN restricts the visibility of a symbol to the executable file
that defines it.

In effect, STV\_DEFAULT implements DLL export and STV\_HIDDEN implements
DLL no export.

The source annotation denoting export is Q-o-I, but we expect
``__declspecl([no]dllexport)`` to be widely used.

.. _exporting:

.. rubric:: Exporting

Exporting a function that can be inlined should force the creation and
export of an out-of-line copy of it. (See also Importing_, below).

When compiling for an SVr4-based environment, symbols with global
binding should have default visibility by default (unless source
annotation or tool options dictate otherwise). The C++ ABI does not
change this.

When compiling for a DLL-based environment, we start from the position that
symbols with global binding should have STV\_HIDDEN visibility by default
(unless source annotation or tool options dictate otherwise). This C++ ABI
modifies this starting point as described in `Inter-DLL visibility rules for
C++ ABI-defined symbols`_.

In some DLL models, addressing an imported datum requires an additional
level of indirection compared with addressing a locally defined one. In
these models, DLL import makes a compile-time distinction between a
reference to a datum exported by some other DLL and one defined by this
DLL.

.. admonition:: Aside
   :class: note

   Under the SVr4 DSO model, all global symbols are addressed indirectly,
   whether imported or not, so no source annotation is needed.  This supports
   pre-emption of any DSO definition at dynamic link time and allows vague
   linkage to be implemented dynamically.

The source annotation denoting import is Q-o-I, but we expect
``__declspecl([no]dllimport)`` to be widely used.

It is Q-o-I whether importing a definition also exports it, whether
exporting a reference also imports it, and how these annotations
interact with compiler steering options. Nevertheless, in ELF,
restricting the visibility of an undefined symbol restricts the
visibility of a definition that matches it at static link time.

.. _importing:

.. rubric:: Importing

Importing a function that can be inlined should suppress the creation of
an out-of-line copy of it, the imported reference being used instead.
(See also Exporting_, above).

Symbol visibility for C++ entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many C++ entities with linkage map one to one via C++ ABI-defined name
mangling [GCPPABI_] to corresponding ELF symbols with global binding.
Examples include many data objects and class member functions. In
principle, the export of these entities can be controlled explicitly by
source annotation, just as in C.

Some C++ ABI-defined global symbols are associated uniquely with an
entity of the above sort. Examples include static data local to a
function that might be inlined and the initialization guard variables
associated with it. In these cases, symbol visibility must follow that
of the export controlled C++ entity (here, the function itself).

Remaining C++ ABI-defined global symbols relate to class impedimenta –
virtual tables and RTTI. Under the generic C++ ABI they are the global
symbols \_ZT{V,T,I,S}\ *type*, where *type* is a mangled class name.

Vague linkage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some C++ entities (including class impedimenta, out of line copies of
inline functions, and the static data and string literals belonging to
them) can have *vague linkage.*

Entities with vague linkage are defined in many relocatable files linked
to form an executable file. Duplication is avoided using COMDAT groups
[GCPPABI_], so there is at most one definition in a DLL, DSO, or
executable file.

To ensure a single definition program wide requires pre-emption of all
but one definition at dynamic link time. In turn this requires that
references to a DLL-local definition can be relocated at dynamic link
time.

Class impedimenta and some other class entities have vague linkage
unless the class has a *key function*. The translation unit containing
the definition of the key function provides a unique point of definition
for the impedimenta. Otherwise, definitions must be emitted wherever
they are used.

Inter-DLL visibility rules for C++ ABI-defined symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For terminology, please refer to `Symbol visibility, DLL export, and DLL
import`_, `Symbol visibility for C++ entities`_, and `Vague linkage`_.

Among C++ entities with linkage, only classes are exported by default
(in the absence of Q-o-I source annotations and compiler options). No
ELF symbol directly represents a class.

If a C++ ABI-defined global (CAG) symbol Y names an entity associated
with a C++ function or data object X:

-  Y must be exported if, and only if, X is exported.

-  Y must be addressed as imported if X is addressed as imported.

If a CAG symbol Y names one of the impedimenta associated with an
exported class X:

-  If X has a *key function* K:

  - Y is exported from the DLL containing the translation unit that
    defines K.

  - Y is addressed as imported in every other DLL containing a
    translation unit that refers to X and uses Y.

-  Otherwise, if X has no *key function*:

  - Y is both exported from, and addressed as imported in, each DLL that
    refers to X and uses Y [1]_.

Strictly, as far as this ABI is concerned, the control of export is
Q-o-I. However, to foster inter-operation between compilers we require
that:

-  A class should be exported unless explicitly tagged otherwise (e.g.
   by class \_\_delcspec(nodllexport) X…).

-  A member of an implicitly exported class should be exported only if
   explicitly tagged as such (e.g. by \_\_delcspec(dllexport) C::f(…)
   {…}).

-  If a class is *explicitly* exported (e.g. by \_\_delcspec(dllexport)
   class X … ) and no class member is explicitly exported then all class
   members should be exported.

-  These rules apply to each class individually. Explicitly exporting a
   class X does not implicitly export any base class of X, or any class
   derived from X.

Some names, despite formally having external linkage, are not usable
outside the translation unit in which they are declared. Names to which
this applies

-  Are declared in unnamed namespaces.

-  Have external C++ linkage but *not* ``extern "C"`` linkage.

Whether such names have local or global binding is Q-o-I but they must
not have dynamic linkage.

One definition rule considerations in the absence of dynamic vague linkage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last rule given in the first half of `Inter-DLL visibility rules for
C++ ABI-defined symbols`_ (“[Otherwise], …”) ensures that a DLL-based
system capable of resolving vague linkage dynamically can give unique
(within the program) addresses to the impedimenta associated with a
class that has no key function.

As observed in `Vague linkage`_, other C++ entities suffer from vague linkage,
but, ultimately, these are all functions, or associated with functions.
If a system cannot resolve vague linkage dynamically, a few simple rules
that can be backed by compiler warnings will serve to alert programmers
to most potential problems with multiple definitions.

For example, a compiler might warn of the following in relation to a
function with vague linkage.

-  Taking its address (it will yield different results in different
   DLLs).

-  Using function local static data (they will be different data in
   different DLLs).

-  Taking the address of a string literal, or passing a string literal
   to other than a library function (the literal will have a different
   address in different DLLs, and this might matter if the address
   rather than the value is stored).

In short, it is feasible and reasonable for a system to avoid these
problems through its programming standards.

However, usage of the class impedimenta cannot be regulated through
programming conventions, so we need different rules for them.
Specifically, we must drop the requirement that one definition should
mean one address. This appears to have no consequence for virtual tables
(symbols matching \_ZT{V,T}\ *type*), as nothing seems to depend on the
address of a virtual table being unique, but it matters for RTTI
(symbols matching \_ZT{I,S}\ *type*).

This runs contrary to §\ `2.9.1`_ of GCPPABI_ which states:

-  It is intended that two type\_info pointers point to equivalent type
   descriptions if and only if the pointers are equal. An implementation
   must satisfy this constraint, e.g. by using symbol preemption, COMDAT
   sections, or other mechanisms.

Fortunately, we can ignore this requirement without violating the C++
standard provided that:

-  type\_info::operator== and type\_info::operator!= compare the strings
   returned by type\_info::name(), not just the pointers to the RTTI
   objects and their names.

-  | No reliance is placed on the address returned by
     type\_info::name().
   | (That is, t1.name() != t2.name() does not imply that t1 != t2).

The first condition effectively requires that these operators (and
type\_info::before()) must be called out of line, and that the execution
environment must provide appropriate implementations of them. A
relocatable file built this way is oblivious to whether or not RTTI
objects have unique addresses.

Finally we need to revisit the last rule of `Inter-DLL visibility rules
for C++ ABI-defined symbols`_ (“[Otherwise], …”). It states:

-  If X is exported but has no key function, Y is both exported from,
   and addressed as imported in, each DLL that refers to X and uses Y.

For any Y for which the execution environment waives the one address
rule, these requirements are pointless. The exported Y will never be
used, and because the system cannot resolve vague linkage dynamically,
there is no need to address the entity named by Y as imported.

Import potentially affects code generation, so this involves a compile
time decision. However, we can note that a system that imports
indirectly – using an extra indirection to access imported data – can in
principle resolve vague linkage dynamically, while one that does not in
general cannot. (But note that SVr4 applications do precisely this by
using copy relocations and a local copy of the data that pre-empts any
DSO copy). So, in practice, code generation is unlikely to be changed
unless a system capable of resolving vague linkage dynamically chooses
not to do so for class impedimenta, or unless code is generated
differently for applications and DLLs.

Export does not affect code generation directly – merely the visibility
of symbols and, hence, the efficiency of export tables. So it is
desirable to drop the export requirement in environments that waive the
one address rule. Doing this at compile time restricts the portability
of the relocatable file. However it is easy to do the restriction at
static link time, as follows.

-  For any global symbol Y whose name matches \_ZT{V,T,S,I}\ *type*, if
   Y is defined in a section belonging to a COMDAT group, reduce Y’s
   visibility to STV\_HIDDEN.

(If Y names an entity whose linkage is not vague, it will not be defined
in a COMDAT group).

Whether implemented at compile time or link time, support by tool chains
is Q-o-I.

ELF binding of static data guard variable symbols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The generic C++ standard [GCPPABI_] states at the end of §\ `5.2.2`_:

  *Some objects with static storage duration have associated guard
  variables used to ensure that they are initialized only once (see
  3.3.2). If the object is emitted using a COMDAT group, the guard
  variable must be too. It is suggested that it be emitted in the same
  COMDAT group as the associated data object, but it may be emitted in its
  own COMDAT group, identified by its name. In either case, it must be
  weak.*

In effect the generic standard permits a producer to generate one of two
alternative structures. Either:

.. code-block::

  COMDAT Group (Variable Name) {
      Defines Variable Name           // ELF binding STB_GLOBAL, mangled name
      Defines Guard Variable Name     // ELF binding STB_WEAK, mangled name ...
  }                                   // (... this ABI requires STB_GLOBAL binding)

Or:

.. code-block::

  COMDAT Group (Variable Name) {
      Defines Variable Name           // ELF binding STB_GLOBAL, mangled name
  }
  +
  COMDAT Group (Guard Variable Name) {
      Defines Guard Variable Name     // ELF binding STB_WEAK, mangled name
  }

A link step involving multiple groups of the first kind causes no
difficulties. A linker must retain only one copy of the group and there
will be one definition of *Variable Name* and one weak definition of
*Guard Variable Name*.

A link step involving pairs of groups of the second kind also causes no
difficulties. A linker must retain one copy of each group so there will
be one definition of *Variable Name* and one weak definition of *Guard
Variable Name*.

A link step involving a group of the first kind and a pair of groups of
the second kind generates two sub-cases.

-  If the linker discards the group that defines two symbols there is no
   problem.

-  If the linker retains the group that defines both *Variable Name* and
   *Guard Variable Name* it must nonetheless retain the group called
   *Guard Variable Name*. There are now two definitions of *Guard
   Variable Name* with ELF binding STB\_WEAK.

In this second case there is no problem provided the linker picks one of
the definitions.

Unfortunately, GELF_ does not specify how linkers must process
multiple weak definitions when there is no non-weak definition to
override them. If a linker faults duplicate weak definitions there will
be a functional failure.

This ABI requires the ELF binding of *Guard Variable Name* in the first
structure to be STB\_GLOBAL.

The rules codified in GELF_ then make all three linking
scenarios well defined and it becomes possible to link the output of
compilers such as armcc that choose the first structure with the output
of those such as gcc that choose the second without relying on linker
behavior that the generic ELF standard leaves unspecified.

   vague linkage`_ for a discussion of this rule and possible
   optimizations of it.
