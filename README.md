# Application Binary Interface for the Arm®  Architecture

This is the official place for the latest documents of the Application Binary
Interface for the Arm® Architecture, both for source files and officially
released documents.


## Transitioning the ABI specs

Currently we are in a transition period while we convert all the ABI
specifications to this new open-source format. One by one, once
the individual documents have been converted, they will appear here, and they
will be included in future releases here on Github.

ABI documents that haven't been converted yet can be found on [the Arm-hosted
developer
site](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/system-architectures/software-standards/abi).

See the *Document locations* section below for links to the individual documents, both here on Github and their last release on developer.arm.com.

## Releases

The latest ABI releases are being made available only here on Github: https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/releases

If there is no entry in the change history table for a release, there are no
changes to the content of the document for that release.

For the last specifications released on developer.arm.com, see the links to the individual documents in the *Document locations* section below.


## Defect reports

Please report defects in or enhancements to the specifications in this folder to
the [issue tracker page on
GitHub](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/issues).

For reporting defects or enhancements to documents that currenlty are not yet
included in this repo and are thus only hosted on developer.arm.com, please send
an email to arm.eabi@arm.com.


## Document locations

See the below tables for the status of the various ABI specifications. A dash represents that the document isn't available either on Github or on the Arm-hosted developer site.
