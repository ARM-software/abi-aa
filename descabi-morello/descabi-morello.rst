About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the Licence_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

About this document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

This document is a draft and all content is at the **Alpha** quality level.
The relocation codes in `Relocation`_ in particular are expected to change.

About This Specification
========================

This specification provides the Morello Descriptor ABI specification for the
Arm 64-bit Architecture (AArch64), and is expected to be used along with MORELLO_ELF_
and MORELLO_PCS_.

Morello Descriptor ABI
======================

The Morello Descriptor ABI is a variant of the pure capability ABI which decouples code and
global data addresses, allowing the same code to be used with multiple instances of global data.
This allows compartments to share code in the same address space, while having separata data
instances.

Morello Descriptor ABI Procedure Call Standard
==============================================

The Morello Descriptor ABI Procedure Call Standard deviates from AAPCS64-cap
in the following ways:

- The general purpose register roles have been changed to allow C28 to be used as a temporary in cross-DSO function calls.

- Executable capabilities are now split into Function and Code capabilities.

- The set of callee-saved registers is changed to allow saving and restoring the Capability Private Data Addressing Register (``c28``) on function calls.

    +------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Global entry points
-------------------

Each function has an additional entry point (the global entry point) that is used to manage
the value of the Capability Private Data Addressing Register. The global entry point is a thunk
generated by the linker and is used for indirect calls or calls from a different DSO.
The global entry point is located in the same DSO as the associated function.

Direct calls will branch to the global entry point using the PLT.
The symbol name for a global entry point is obtained by prefixing ``__descglobal_`` to the
function name.

The Capability Link Register and the caller Capability Private Data Addressing Register
are saved in c19 and c20. On return, the global entry point restores the caller Capability
Private Data Addressing Register and the saved Capability Link Register.

This is an example of a code sequence that implements a global entry point for a symbol ``sym``:

.. code-block:: text

   __descglobal_sym:
       mov c19, c28
       mov c28, c29
       mov c20, clr
       .cfi_register clr, c20
       bl sym
       mov c28, c19
       ret c20

Capabilities
------------

The Descriptor ABI executable capabilities are categorized as Function capabilities and Code capabilities.

Code Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code capabilities have object type ``RB``, executable permissions and can be used for indirect branches
restricted to the current DSO. Code capabilities are not used for function calls.

Function Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Function capabilities have object type ``LPB``. The value of the capability will point to
a memory location which contains two capabilities:

- The first capability is the Capability Private Data Addressing Register value for the called function.

- The second capability is a code capability which contains the address of the global entry point of the called function.

Function capabilities must be called using a ``ldpb(l)r c29, [cN]`` instruction.

Morello Descriptor ABI ELF Extensions
=====================================


Private data sections
---------------------

The following sections are now part of a ``PT_MORELLO_DESC`` segment with the ``p_type`` value 0x70001000:

- ``.desc.data.rel.ro``

- ``.got``

- ``.data``

- ``.bss``


The value of the Capability Private Data Addressing Register (c28) points to the start of the ``PT_MORELLO_DESC``
segment, is read-only and can be used to access the ``.desc.data.rel.ro`` and ``.got`` sections.

The PT_MORELLO_DESC segment is similar to a TLS segment and can be moved to a different address by
the runtime of dynamic linker.

PLT sequence
------------

The PLT sequence for the Morello Descriptor ABI is:

.. code-block:: text

    adrp c16, :got:foo
    add c16, c16. :got_lo12:foo
    ldr c29, [c16]
    ldpbr c29, [c29]

Relocation
----------

Relocation operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following nomenclature is used in the descriptions of relocation operations:

- ``S`` (when used on its own) is the address of the symbol.

- ``A`` is the addend for the relocation.

- ``P`` is the address of the place being relocated (derived from ``r_offset``).

- ``D`` is the start of the section if the relocated symbol is the PT_MORELLO_DESC segment or equal to ``P`` otherwise

- ``C`` is 1 if the target symbol ``S`` has type ``STT_FUNC`` and the symbol
  addresses a C64 instruction; it is 0 otherwise.

- ``X`` is the result of a relocation operation, before any masking or
  bit-selection operation is applied

- ``Page(expr)`` is the page address of the expression expr, defined as (``expr &
  ~0xFFF``). This applies even if the machine page size supported by the platform
  has a different value.

- ``GOT`` is the address of the Global Offset Table, the table of code and data
  addresses to be resolved at dynamic link time. The ``GOT`` and each entry in it
  must be aligned to the pointer-size.

- ``GDAT(S+A)`` represents a pointer-sized entry in the ``GOT`` for address
  ``S+A``. The entry will be relocated at run time with relocation
  ``R_MORELLO_GLOB_DAT(S+A)``.

- ``G(expr)`` is the address of the GOT entry for the expression expr.

- ``CAP_INIT`` generates a capability with all required information. This performs
  the operation required to resolve a ``R_MORELLO_CAPINIT`` relocation (see MORELLO_ELF_).

- ``CAP_DESC_INIT`` generates a capability with all required information. This operation
  is descriptor-ABI-aware. When applied to symbols with type ``STT_FUNC`` this will produce
  a capability sealed with type ``LPB`` to the global entry point of the symbol. The
  resulting capability can be used with an ``ldpblr`` instruction to perform a call.

- ``CAP_SIZE`` is the size of the underlying memory region that the capability can
  reference. This may not directly map to the symbol size.

- ``CAP_PERM`` is the permission of the capability. This may not directly map to
  the type of the symbol.

- ``[msb:lsb]`` is a bit-mask operation representing the selection of bits in a
  value. The bits selected range from ``lsb`` up to ``msb`` inclusive. For
  example, ‘bits [3:0]’ represents the bits under the mask 0x0000000F. When
  range checking is applied to a value, it is applied before the masking
  operation is performed.

Call and Jump relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The call and jump relocation have the same semantics as ``R_MORELLO_CALL26``, ``R_MORELLO_JUMP26``,
``R_AARCH64_CALL26`` and ``R_AARCH64_JUMP26`` respectively (see MORELLO_ELF_).

Relaxation Relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The linker can perform relaxations for call sequences to avoid using the global
entry point or having to save and restore the c19 and c20 registers. If performing
these relaxations the linker will adjust all relevant DWARF information.

Call relaxation
+++++++++++++++

The ``R_MORELLO_DESC_CALL`` relocation is used to mark call sequences for relaxation. The sequences have
the following form:

.. code-block:: text

    stp c19, c20, [...]
    bl $sym
    ldp c19, c20, [...]

The second instruction in the sequence must have a ``R_MORELLO_DESC_GLOBAL_CALL26`` relocation
against it. The instruction sequence should contain no other relocations. If ``sym`` is in the
same DSO as the call site the sequence can be relaxed to:

.. code-block:: text

    nop
    bl $sym
    nop

with the ``R_MORELLO_DESC_GLOBAL_CALL26`` relocation being changed to a ``R_MORELLO_CALL26``
relocation.

Tail call relaxation
++++++++++++++++++++

The ``R_MORELLO_DESC_TCALL`` relocation is used to mark call sequences for relaxation.
The sequences have the following form:

.. code-block:: text

    stp c19, c20, [csp, #32]!
    bl $sym
    ldp c19, c20, [csp], #32
    ret c30

The second instruction in the sequence must have a ``R_MORELLO_DESC_GLOBAL_CALL26`` relocation
against it. The instruction sequence should contain no other relocations. If ``sym`` is in the
same DSO as the call site the sequence can be relaxed to:

.. code-block:: text

    nop
    b $sym
    nop
    nop

with the ``R_MORELLO_DESC_GLOBAL_CALL26`` relocation being changed to a ``R_MORELLO_JUMP26``
relocation.

.. note::

  ``R_MORELLO_DESC_CAPINIT`` instructs the runtime or dynamic loader to create a 16-byte
  capability at ``r_offset``. ``r_offset`` must be 16-byte aligned. Creates a function
  capability if the type of ``S`` is ``STT_FUNC``.

  ``R_MORELLO_DESC_GLOB_DAT`` instructs the runtime or dynamic loader to create a 16-byte
  capability in the GOT entry identified by ``r_offset``. The capability holds the
  address of a data symbol which must be resolved at load time when dynamic
  linking.

  ``R_MORELLO_DESC_JUMP_SLOT`` instructs the dynamic loader to create a 16-byte capability
  in the GOT entry identified by r_offset. The capability holds the address of a
  function symbol which must be resolved at load time. Creates a function capability.

  ``R_MORELLO_DESC_RELATIVE`` represents an optimization of ``R_MORELLO_DESC_GLOB_DAT``.
  It can be used when the symbol resolves to the current shared object or executable and
  the relocation result is not in the ``PT_MORELLO_DESC`` segment. ``S`` must be the ``Null``
  symbol (Index 0). The address and permissions must be written to the fragment.
  Creates a code or data capability.

  ``R_MORELLO_DESC_DAT_RELATIVE`` - similar to ``R_MORELLO_DESC_RELATIVE`` and should
  be used when the relocated value is in the ``PT_MORELLO_DESC`` segment. Creates
  a data capability.

  ``R_MORELLO_DESC_FUNC_RELATIVE`` represents an optimization of ``R_MORELLO_DESC_JUMP_SLOT``.
  It can be used when the symbol resolves to the current shared object or executable. ``S``
  must be the ``Null`` symbol (Index 0). The address and permissions must be written
  to the fragment. Creates a function capability.

  ``R_MORELLO_DESC_IRELATIVE`` is used by the linker when transforming ``IFUNC`` s. The
  rest are the same as ``R_MORELLO_DESC_RELATIVE``

All of the above relocations are against the ``PT_MORELLO_DESC segment``. The fragment encoding
is the same as for the ``R_MORELLO_RELATIVE`` relocation (see MORELLO_ELF_).

When creating function capabilities the runtime or dynamic linker will allocate space for two capabilities:

- The first capability is the value of the Capability Private Data Addressing Register corresponding
  to the DSO of the function. The address and base of this capability are the start of the
  ``.desc.data.rel.ro`` section. This capability is read-only and has the bounds of the
  ``.desc.data.rel.ro`` section.

- The second capability is a code capability pointing to the global entry point of the function.


The runtime or dynamic linker must guarantee that function capabilities produced by relocations
are bitwise equal if and only if the virtual address of the location that would be jumped to using
``ldpblr`` instruction is the same.


Static linking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The linker will emit ``R_MORELLO_RELATIVE``, ``R_MORELLO_DESC_RELATIVE``, ``R_MORELLO_DESC_FUNC_RELATIVE``
and ``R_MORELLO_DESC_IRELATIVE`` dynamic relocations. These relocations need to be processed by the
runtime at program start-up.
