Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You
under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of

About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the Licence_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

About this document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI specifications:

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

Content relating to SVE and Pointer Authentication should be considered as
having a **Beta** support level. This includes:

* DWARF register names marked as **Beta** in `DWARF register names`_
* Call frame instructions (`Call frame instructions`_)
* DWARF expression operations (`DWARF expression operations`_)

All other content in this document is at the **Release** quality level.

Overview
========

The ABI for the Arm 64-bit architecture specifies the use of DWARF 3.0 format
debugging data. For details of the base standard see GDWARF_.

The ABI for the Arm 64-bit architecture gives additional rules for how DWARF 3.0
should be used, and how it is extended in ways specific to the Arm 64-bit
architecture. The following topics are covered in detail:

- The enumeration of DWARF register numbers for using in ``.debug_frame`` and
  ``.debug_info`` sections (`DWARF register names`_).
- The definition of *Canonical Frame Address* (CFA) used by this ABI
  (`Canonical frame address`_).
- The definition of *Common Information Entries* (CIE) used by this
  ABI (`Common information entries`_).
- The definition of *Call Frame Instructions* (CFI) used by this ABI
  (`Call frame instructions`_).
- The definition of DWARF Expression Operations used by this ABI
  (`dwarf expression operations`_).

Arm-specific DWARF definitions
==============================

DWARF register names
--------------------

GDWARF_, §2.6.1, Register Name Operators, suggests that the mapping from a DWARF
register name to a target register number should be defined by the ABI for the
target architecture. DWARF register names are encoded as unsigned LEB128
integers.

.. note::

   .. _Note 1:

   1. The size of a general register is to be taken from context. For instance in a
      ``.debug_info`` section if the ``DW_AT_location`` attribute of a variable is
      ``DW_OP_reg0`` then the number of significant bits in the register is
      determined by the variable’s ``DW_AT_type`` attribute. If no context is
      available (for example in ``.debug_frame`` or ``.eh_frame`` sections) then
      the register number refers to a 64-bit register.

   .. _Note 2:

   2. The value of the SVE vector granule pseudo-register is an even integer in
      the range 2 to 32. The value of the register is the available size in bits
      of the SVE vector registers in the current call frame divided by 64.

   .. _Note 3:

   3. The SVE vector granule pseudo-register enables the construction of DWARF
      expressions that require the use of the current vector length, such as the
      location of saved SVE predicate and vector registers on the stack using the
      DWARF stack frame operator ``DW_CFA_expression``.

   .. _Note 4:

   4. The available size of a SVE predicate register and the first fault register
      is VG × 8-bits.

   .. _Note 5:

   5. In a similar manner to the general register file the size of an FP/Advanced
      SIMD register is taken from some external context to the register number. If
      no context is available then only the least significant 64 bits of the
      register are referenced. In particular this means that the most significant
      part of a SIMD register is unrecoverable by frame unwinding.

   .. _Note 6:

   6. The available size of the SVE vector registers is VG × 64-bits.

   .. _Note 7:

   7. The architecture defines that the FP/Advanced SIMD registers (V registers)
      overlap with the SVE vector registers (Z registers). A given V register is
      mapped to the low 128-bits of the corresponding Z register.

      The DWARF call frame instructions do not explicitly specify the size of a
      register; this is implicit in the definition of the register. As a
      consequence the V registers and Z registers have been allocated separate
      DWARF register number ranges which have their own definition for the size of
      these registers.

      When searching the call frame information table for either a V register or a
      Z register a consumer must take into account the aliasing between the V and
      Z registers.

   .. _Note 8:

   8. The RA_SIGN_STATE pseudo-register records whether the return address has
      been signed with a PAC. This information can be used when unwinding. It
      is an unsigned integer with the same size as a general register. Only
      bit[0] is meaningful and is initialized to zero. A value of 0 indicates
      the return address has not been signed. A value of 1 indicates the return
      address has been signed.

   .. _Note 9:

   9. Normally, the program counter is restored from the return address, however
      having both LR and PC columns is useful for describing asynchronously
      created stack frames. A DWARF expression may use this register to restore
      the context in case of a signal context.

Canonical frame address
-----------------------

The term Canonical Frame Address (CFA) is defined in GDWARF_, §6.4, Call Frame
Information.

This ABI adopts the typical definition of CFA given there:

  The CFA is the value of the stack pointer (sp) at the call site in the
  previous frame.

Common information entries
--------------------------

The DWARF virtual unwinding model is based, conceptually, on a tabular structure
with one column for each target register (GDWARF_, §6.4.1, Structure of Call
Frame Information). A ``.debug_frame`` Common Information Entry (CIE) specifies
the initial values (on entry to an associated function) of each register.

The variability of execution environments conforming to the Arm architecture
creates a problem for this model. A producer cannot reliably enumerate all the
registers in the target. For example, an integer-only function might be included
in one executable file for use in execution environments with floating-point and
another for use in environments without. In effect, it must be acceptable for a
producer not to initialize, in a CIE, registers it does not know about. In turn
this generates an obligation on consuming debuggers to default missing initial
values.

This generates the following obligations on producers and consumers of CIEs:

1. Consumers must default the CIE initial value of any target register not
   mentioned explicitly in the CIE.

   * Callee-saved registers (and registers intentionally unused by the program,
     for example as a consequence of the procedure call standard) should be
     initialized as if by ``DW_CFA_same_value``, other registers as if by
     ``DW_CFA_undefined``.

     A debugger can use built-in knowledge of the procedure call standard or can
     deduce which registers are callee-saved by scanning all CIEs.

   * The VG pseudo-register should be initialized as if by
     ``DW_CFA_same_value``.

   * The ``RA_SIGN_STATE`` pseudo-register should be initialized as described in
     `DWARF register names`_ `Note 8`_.

2. To allow consumers to reliably default the initial values of missing entries
   by scanning a program’s CIEs, without recourse to built-in knowledge,
   producers must identify registers not preserved by callees, as follows:

   * If a function uses any register from a particular hardware register class
     (e.g. Arm core registers), its associated CIE must initialize all the
     registers of that class that are not callee-saved to ``DW_CFA_undefined``.

   * If a function uses a callee-saved register R, its associated CIE must
     initialize R using one of the defined value methods (not
     ``DW_CFA_undefined``).

   (As an optimization, a producer need not initialize registers it can prove
   cannot be used by any associated functions and their descendants. Although
   these are not callee-saved, they are not callee-used either.)

This ABI defines two CIE augmentation characters that may appear as part of
a CIE augmentation string.

1. The character 'B' indicates that associated frames are using the B key for
   return address signing.

2. The character 'G' indicates that associated frames may modify MTE tags on
   the stack space they use.


.. note::

    1. The mark on a frame recording that it may have set MTE tags other than the
       stack background is information which can be used when unwinding.

----------------------------------

This ABI defines one vendor call frame instruction
``DW_CFA_AARCH64_negate_ra_state``.

.. class:: aadwarf64-vendor-cfa-operations

.. table:: AArch64 vendor CFA operations

   +------------------------------------+-------------+------------+-----------+-----------+
   | Instruction                        | High 2 bits | Low 6 bits | Operand 1 | Operand 2 |
   +====================================+=============+============+===========+===========+
   | ``DW_CFA_AARCH64_negate_ra_state`` | 0           | ``0x2D``   | \-        | \-        |
   +------------------------------------+-------------+------------+-----------+-----------+

The ``DW_CFA_AARCH64_negate_ra_state`` operation negates bit[0] of the
RA_SIGN_STATE pseudo-register. It does not take any operands.

.. _DWARF expression operations:

DWARF expression operations (**Beta**)
--------------------------------------

This ABI defines one vendor DWARF expression operation
``DW_OP_AARCH64_operation``.

.. class:: dwarf64-vendor-dwarf-expression-operations

.. table:: AArch64 vendor DWARF expression operations

   +-----------------------------+----------+
   | Operation                   | Code     |
   +=============================+==========+
   | ``DW_OP_AARCH64_operation`` | ``0xea`` |
   +-----------------------------+----------+

The ``DW_OP_AARCH64_operation`` takes one mandatory operand encoded
as an unsigned LEB128. Bits[6:0] of this value specify an AArch64
DWARF Expression sub-operation. The remaining operands and the
action performed are as specified by the sub-operation. The
``DW_OP_AARCH64_operation`` allows this ABI to define operations
specific to the Arm 64-bit architecture outside the encoding space
of DWARF expression operations.

.. class:: aadwarf64-dwarf-expression-sub-operations

.. table:: AArch64 DWARF expression sub-operations

   +-----------------------------+----------+
   | Sub-operation               | Code     |
   +=============================+==========+
   | ``DW_SUB_OP_AARCH64_sign``  | ``0x00`` |
   +-----------------------------+----------+

The ``DW_SUB_OP_AARCH64_sign`` sub-operation takes a single operand
encoded as an unsigned LEB128 operand. This value specifies a pointer
key signing operation given in the `AArch64 DWARF pointer signing operations`_ table. The top
two stack stack entries are popped, the first is treated as an 8-byte
address value to be signed and the second is treated as an 8-byte salt.
The key signing operation is performed on the address value using the
salt, and the result is pushed to the stack.

    | Operation                           | Code    |
    +=====================================+=========+
    | Sign Instruction address with Key A | ``0x0`` |

    +-------------------------------------+---------+
    | Sign address with Generic key       | ``0x4`` |
    +-------------------------------------+---------+

Vector types (**Beta**)
-----------------------

The recommended way of describing an Advanced SIMD or SVE vector type is
to use an array type (``DW_TAG_array_type``) that has the GNU vector type
attribute (``DW_AT_GNU_vector``, code ``0x2107``).  The array index for these
vectors has a lower bound of zero.  For variable-length SVE vectors,
the upper bound (``DW_AT_upper_bound``) or element count (``DW_AT_count``)
is an expression based on the VG pseudo-register.  For Advanced SIMD
vectors and fixed-length SVE vectors, the upper bound or element count
is constant.

For example, the recommended representation of the SVE type ``svfloat32_t`` is:

.. code-block:: text

   DW_TAG_array_type
     DW_AT_name("...")
     DW_AT_GNU_vector
     DW_AT_type(reference to float)
     DW_TAG_subrange_type
       DW_AT_upper_bound(expression=
         DW_OP_bregx(46, 0)
         DW_OP_lit2
         DW_OP_mul
         DW_OP_lit1
         DW_OP_minus)

if using ``DW_AT_upper_bound`` and:

.. code-block:: text

   DW_TAG_array_type
     DW_AT_name("...")
     DW_AT_GNU_vector
     DW_AT_type(reference to float)
     DW_TAG_subrange_type
       DW_AT_count(expression=
         DW_OP_bregx(46, 0)
         DW_OP_lit2
         DW_OP_mul)

if using ``DW_AT_count``.  Note that the zero lower bound is implicit for
C and C++.
