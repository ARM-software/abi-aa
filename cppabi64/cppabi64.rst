Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You
under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the Licence_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

About this document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI specifications:

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

All content in this document is at the **Release** quality level.

Change History
--------------

If there is no entry in the change history table for a release, there are no
changes to the content of the document for that release.

Overview
========

The C++ ABI for the Arm 64-bit architecture (CPPABI64) comprises the
following sub-components.

* The generic C++ ABI, summarized in `The Generic C++ ABI`_, is the
  referenced base standard for this component.

* The C++ ABI supplement in `The C++ ABI Supplement`_ details
  Arm-specific additions to and deviations from the generic standard.

* The generic C++ exception handling ABI summarized in `The Exception
  Handling ABI for the Arm architecture`_, describes the
  language-independent and C++-specific aspects of exception handling.

* The C++ exception handling supplement for AArch64 in `EH ABI Level
  I: Implementation ABI for AArch64`_ details Arm-specific adddtions
  to and deviations from the generic standard.

* The C++ exception handling ABI supplement for GNU/Linux in `EH ABI
  Level III: Implementation ABI for GNU Linux`_ details Arm-specific
  additions to and deviations from the generic standard for GNU/Linux
  systems.

The generic C++ ABI is implicitly an SVr4-based standard, and takes an
SVr4 position on symbol visibility and vague linkage. This document
does not cover extensions for DLL-based environments.

The Generic C++ ABI
-------------------

The generic C++ ABI [GCPPABI_] (originally developed for SVr4 on
Itanium) specifies:

* The layout of C++ non-POD class types in terms of the layout of POD
  types (specified for this ABI by the Procedure Call Standard for the
  Arm 64-bit Architecture [AAPCS64_]).

* How class types requiring copy construction are passed as parameters
  and results.

* The content of run-time type information (RTTI).

* Necessary APIs for object construction and destruction.

* How names with linkage are mangled (name mangling).

The generic C++ ABI refers to a separate Itanium-specific
specification of exception handling. When the generic C++ ABI is used
as a component of this ABI, corresponding reference must be made to
the generic C++ exception handling ABI as summarised in `The Exception
Handling ABI for the Arm architecture`_, and the C++ exception
handling ABI supplement in `EH ABI Level III: Implementation ABI for
GNU Linux`_.


The Exception Handling ABI for the Arm architecture
---------------------------------------------------

In common with [IA64EHABI_], this ABI specifies table-based unwinding
that separates language-independent unwinding from language specific
aspects. The [IA64EHABI_] specification describes three levels of ABI:

    Level I. A Base API, interfaces common to all languages and implementations.

    Level II. The C++ ABI, interfaces for interoperability of C++ implementations.

    Level III. The Implementation ABI specific to a particular runtime implementation.

`EH ABI Level I: Implementation ABI for AArch64`_ describes EH Level I
ABI used on AArch64 systems.

The AArch64 C++ EH ABI uses Level II of the Itanium exception handling
ABI as specified.

`EH ABI Level III: Implementation ABI for GNU Linux`_ describes the EH
Level III ABI used on GNU/Linux systems.


The C++ ABI Supplement
======================


Summary of differences from and additions to the generic C++ ABI
----------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes the differences between the C++ ABI for the
Arm 64-bit architecture and the generic C++ ABI. Section numbers in
captions refer to the generic C++ ABI specification. Larger
differences are detailed in subsections of `Differences in detail`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 2.2_ **POD Data Types**

The GC++ABI defines the way in which empty class types are laid out.
For the purposes of parameter passing in [AAPCS64_], a parameter whose
type is an empty class shall be treated as if its type were an
aggregate with a single member of type unsigned byte.

.. note::

    Of course, the single member has undefined content.


**GC++ABI §**\ 2.3_ **Member Pointers**

The pointer to member function representation differs from that used
by Itanium. See `Representation of pointer to member function`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 2.8_ **Initialization guard variables**

This ABI only specifies the bottom bit of the guard variable. See
`Guard variables`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 3.1.3_ **Return Values**

When a return value has a non-trivial copy constructor or destructor,
the address of the caller-allocated temporary is passed in the
Indirect Result Location Register (r8) rather than as an implicit
first parameter before the ``this`` parameter and user parameters.

**GC++ABI §**\ 3.3.5_ **Controlling Object Construction Order**

Global object construction is managed in a simplified way under this
ABI. See `Controlling Object Construction Order`_.

**GC++ABI §**\ 3.4_ **Demangler**

This ABI provides the demangler interface as specified in the generic
C++ ABI. The ABI does not specify the format of the demangled string.

**GC++ABI §**\ 5.1.5_ **Builtin Types**

The ``__bf16`` is mangled as ``u6__bf16``.

**GC++ABI §**\ 5.2.2_ **Static Data**

If a static datum and its guard variable are emitted in the same
COMDAT group, the ELF binding [GELF_] for both symbols must be
``STB_GLOBAL``, not ``STB_WEAK`` as specified in [GCPPABI_]. `ELF
binding of static data guard variable symbols`_ justifies this
requirement.

**GC++ABI §**\ 5.3_ **Unwind Table Location**

The exception unwind table shall be located by use of program header
entries of type ``PT_AARCH64_UNWIND``. See `Unwind Table Location`_.

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI) A library nothrow new function must not examine its 2nd argument**

Library versions of the following functions must not examine their
second argument.

.. code-block:: c++

    ::operator new(std::size_t, const std::nothrow_t&)
    ::operator new[](std::size_t, const std::nothrow_t&)

(The second argument conveys no useful information other than through
its presence or absence, which is manifest in the mangling of the name
of the function. This ABI therefore allows code generators to use a
potentially invalid second argument – for example, whatever value
happens to be in R1 – at a point of call).

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI, but would be §**\ 2.2_\ **) POD data types**

Pointers to ``extern "C++"`` functions and pointers to ``extern "C"``
functions are interchangeable if the function types are otherwise
identical.

In order to be used by the library helper functions described below,
implementations of constructor and destructor functions (complete,
sub-object, deleting, and allocating) must have a type compatible
with:

.. code-block:: c++

    extern "C" void (*)(void* /* , other argument types if any */);

**(No section in the generic C++ ABI) Namespace and mangling for the** ``va_list`` **type**

The type ``__va_list`` is in namespace std. The type name of
``va_list`` therefore mangles to ``St9__va_list``.


Differences in detail
---------------------

Representation of pointer to member function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The generic C++ ABI [GCPPABI_] specifies that a pointer to member
function is a pair of words ``<ptr, adj>``. The least significant bit
of ``ptr`` discriminates between (0) the address of a non-virtual
member function and (1) the offset in the class’s virtual table of the
address of a virtual function.

This encoding cannot work for the AArch64 instruction set where the
architecture reserves all bits of code addresses.

This ABI specifies that ``adj`` contains twice the ``this``
adjustment, plus 1 if the member function is virtual. The least
significant bit of ``adj`` then makes exactly the same discrimination
as the least significant bit of ``ptr`` does for Itanium.

A pointer to member function is NULL when ``ptr = 0`` and the least
significant bit of ``adj`` is zero.


Guard variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The generic C++ ABI [GCPPABI_] specifies the bottom byte of a static
variable guard variable shall be 0 when the variable is not
initialized, and 1 when it is. All other bytes are platform defined.

This ABI instead only specifies the value bit 0 of the static guard
variable; all other bits are platform defined. Bit 0 shall be 0 when
the variable is not initialized and 1 when it is.


Controlling Object Construction Order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The generic ABI specifies a ``#pragma`` and ``.priority_init`` section
type to allow the user to specify object construction order. This
scheme is not in wide use and so this ABI uses a different scheme
which has several pre-existing implementations.

The compiler is responsible for sequencing the construction of
top-level static objects defined in a translation unit in accordance
with the requirements of the C++ standard. The run-time environment
(helper-function library) sequences the initialization of one
translation unit after another. The global constructor vector provides
the interface between these agents as follows:

- Each translation unit provides a fragment of the constructor vector
  in an ELF section called ``.init_array`` of type ``SHT_INIT_ARRAY``
  (=0xE) and section flags ``SHF_ALLOC + SHF_WRITE``.

- Each element of the vector contains the address of a function of
  type ``extern "C" void (* const)(void)`` that, when called, performs
  part or all of the global object construction for the translation
  unit. Producers must treat ``.init_array`` sections as if they were
  read-only.

- The appropriate entry for an element referring to, say,
  ``__sti_file`` that constructs the global static objects in filecpp,
  is 0 relocated by ``R_AARCH64_ABS64`` (``__sti_file``).

- Object construction order may be controlled by appending an unsigned
  integer in the range 0-65535 (formatted as if by ``printf("%05d",
  priority)``) to the name of the section. The linker must lay these
  sections out in ascending lexicographical order.

- Sections without a priority number appended are assumed to have a
  lower priority than those sections with a priority number. The
  linker should lay out sections without a priority number after those

ELF binding of static data guard variable symbols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The generic C++ standard [GCPPABI_] states at the end of §5.2.2:

   Local static data objects generally have associated guard variables
   used to ensure that they are initialized only once (see 3.3.2). If
   the object is emitted using a COMDAT group, the guard variable must
   be too. It is suggested that it be emitted in the same COMDAT group
   as the associated data object, but it may be emitted in its own
   COMDAT group, identified by its name. In either case, it must be
   weak.

In effect the generic standard permits a producer to generate one of
two alternative structures. Either:

::

    COMDAT Group (Variable Name) {
        Defines Variable Name       // ELF binding STB_GLOBAL, mangled name
        Defines Guard Variable Name // ELF binding STB_WEAK, mangled name ...
    }                               // (... this ABI requires STB_GLOBAL binding)

Or:

::

    COMDAT Group (Variable Name) {
        Defines Variable Name       // ELF binding STB_GLOBAL, mangled name
    }
    +
    COMDAT Group (Guard Variable Name) {
        Defines Guard Variable Name // ELF binding STB_WEAK, mangled name
    }

A link step involving multiple groups of the first kind causes no
difficulties. A linker must retain only one copy of the group and
there will be one definition of Variable Name and one weak definition
of Guard Variable Name.

A link step involving pairs of groups of the second kind also causes
no difficulties. A linker must retain one copy of each group so there
will be one definition of Variable Name and one weak definition of
Guard Variable Name.

A link step involving a group of the first kind and a pair of groups
of the second kind generates two sub-cases.

- If the linker discards the group that defines two symbols there is
  no problem.

- If the linker retains the group that defines both Variable Name and
  Guard Variable Name it must nonetheless retain the group called
  Guard Variable Name. There are now two definitions of Guard Variable
  Name with ELF binding ``STB_WEAK``.

In this second case there is no problem provided the linker picks one
of the definitions.

Unfortunately, [GELF_] does not specify how linkers must process
multiple weak definitions when there is no non-weak definition to
override them. If a linker faults duplicate weak definitions there
will be a functional failure.

This ABI requires the ELF binding of Guard Variable Name in the first
structure to be ``STB_GLOBAL``.

The rules codified in [GELF_] then make all three linking scenarios
well defined and it becomes possible to link the output of compilers
such as armcc that choose the first structure with the output of those
such as gcc that choose the second without relying on linker behavior
that the generic ELF standard leaves unspecified.


Unwind Table Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exception tables are located in sections with the name ``.eh_frame``
and ``.eh_frame_hdr``. Linkers shall put the ``.eh_frame_hdr`` section
in a single text segment, with a ``PT_AARCH64_UNWIND`` program table
entry identifying the unwind table header location.

EH ABI Level I: Implementation ABI for AArch64
==============================================

See [IA64EHABI_] §1.


Transferring Control to a Landing Pad
-------------------------------------
See [IA64EHABI_] §1.6.3.

The unwind library may elect to transfer control to landing pads via a jump
instruction that requires the jump target to be identified as a valid
destination for indirect jumps.

.. note::
   The intent is that the landing pads should start with a ``bti j`` instruction
   (or equivalent), when they might operate in an environment with Branch Target
   Identification enabled.

EH ABI Level III: Implementation ABI for GNU Linux
==================================================

Introduction
------------

This section describes the Exception Handling Implementation ABI for GNU Linux systems.

It specifies:

* The format of the unwind tables

* Standard Runtime Initialization features

* Throwing an Exception

* Catching an Exception

This section follows the layout of [IA64EHABI_] §3.


Data Structures
---------------

The format of the exception tables is as specified in [LSB_] §II.11.6
(Exception Frames).

The codes used to describe the encoding of pointers used in the
exception frame tables, are the values described in [LSB_] §II.11.5.1
(DWARF Exception Header Encoding).

Note that in particular that the layout of the Language Specific Data
Area (LSDA) is not specified by this ABI. The structure and layout of
a LSDA is specific to a particular implementation of a personality
routine.


Standard Runtime Initialization
-------------------------------

See [IA64EHABI_] §3.3.


Throwing an Exception
---------------------

See [IA64EHABI_] §3.4.


Catching an Exception
---------------------


Overview of Catch Processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stack unwinding itself is begun by calling
``__Unwind_RaiseException()``, and performed by the unwind library.
See [IA64EHABI_] §3.5 for a summary.


The Personality Routine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The personality routine is specified in [IA64EHABI_] §2.5.2.

Exception Handlers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The behavior of exception handlers is described in [IA64EHABI_] §2.5.3.
