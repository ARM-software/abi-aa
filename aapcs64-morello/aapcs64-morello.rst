Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You
under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the Licence_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

Contributions to this project are licensed under an inbound=outbound
model such that any such contributions are licensed by the contributor
under the same terms as those in the `Licence`_ section.

About this document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

This document is a draft and all content is at the **Alpha** quality level.

Change history
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is no entry in the change history table for a release, there are no
changes to the content of the document for that release.

Terms and Abbreviations
-----------------------

The ABI for the Arm 64-bit Architecture uses the following terms and abbreviations in addition
to the terms and abbreviations used in the AAPCS64_ document.

AAPCS64-cap
    The pure capability Procedure Call Standard for the Arm 64-bit
    Architecture (AArch64)

C64
    Execution state where PSTATE.C64 is set.

A64
    Execution state where PSTATE.C64 is cleared.

Capability
    The capability data type is an unforgeable token of authority which provides
    a foundation for fine grained memory protection and strong compartmentalisation.

Deriving a capability
    A capability value CV2 is said to be derived from a capability value CV1
    when CV2 is a copy of CV1 with optionally removed permissions and/or
    optionally narrowed bounds (base increased or limit reduced).

More specific terminology is defined when it is first used.

Scope
=====

This document extends the AAPCS64 calling convention described in
the AAPCS64_ document in order to add support for capabilities, and adds an
additional Procedure Calling Standard (AAPCS64-cap). AAPCS64-cap is identical to AAPCS64,
except for the differences documented here.

.. raw:: pdf

Introduction
============

The AAPCS64 is the first revision of Procedure Call standard for the Arm 64-bit Architecture. It forms part of the complete ABI specification for the Arm 64-bit Architecture.

The AAPCS64-cap is a Procedure Call standard for the Arm 64-bit Architecture designed to implement a software environment where all memory accesses are performed using capabilities.

Design Goals
------------

AAPCS64 and AAPCS64-cap have the same design goals as described in the AAPCS64_ document.

An additional design goal for the capability-aware AAPCS64 is to support interworking with legacy AAPCS64 code, following only the Procedure Calling Standard described in the AAPCS64_                 document.

Conformance
-----------

The AAPCS64 and AAPCS64-cap have the same conformance rules as defined in AAPCS64_, with the additional requirement that:

- At each call where the control transfer instruction is subject to a BL-type relocation at static link time, rules on the use of r16 and r17 (CIP0, CIP1, IP0, IP1) are observed (`Use of CIP0 and CIP1 by the linker`_).

Data Types and Alignment
========================

Fundamental Data Types
----------------------

`Byte size and byte alignment of Morello-specific fundamental data types`_ shows the additional fundamental data types (Machine Types) of the machine that
are available in AAPCS64 and AAPCS64-cap, in addition to the fundamental data types shown in the AAPCS64_ document.

    +------------------------+-------------------------+------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+


Capabilities
------------

Capabilities are 129-bit types which encode a 64 bit value and extra information such as the bounds of the allocation the value is addressing and access permissions.
Each capability has a single-bit tag associated with it that is tracked by the hardware, used to guarantee that the capability is unforgeable. The size of the capability in memory is 16
bytes, with the tag bit being stored separately at the corresponding capability tag location. A capability must be stored in memory at a 16-byte aligned address.

A NULL capability is represented by a capability with all bits zero, and the tag bit cleared.

A comparison between two capabilities will be performed by comparing the value fields of the two capabilities.

The Base Procedure Call Standard
================================

The base standard defines a machine-level calling standard for the A64 instruction set. It assumes the availability of the vector registers for passing floating-point and SIMD arguments.


Machine Registers
-----------------

The Arm 64-bit architecture defines two mandatory register banks:

- A general-purpose register bank which can be used for scalar integer processing and pointer arithmetic.

- A SIMD and Floating-Point register bank.

General-purpose Registers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are thirty-one, 128 bit (with one additional tag bit), general-purpose (capability) registers visible to the A64 and C64 states; these are labelled r0-r30.

- In a 64-bit context these registers are normally referred to using the names x0-x30.

- In a 32-bit context the registers are specified by using w0-w30.

- In a capability context the registers are specified by using c0-c30.

Additionally, a stack-pointer register, SP in a 64-bit context or CSP in a capability context, can be used with a restricted number of instructions. Register names may appear in assembly language in either upper case or lower case. In this specification when the register has a fixed role in this procedure call standard, upper case is used.

- `General purpose registers and AAPCS64-cap usage`_ summarize the uses of the general-purpose registers for AAPCS64-cap.

- `General purpose registers and AAPCS64 usage`_ summarize the uses of the general-purpose registers for AAPCS64.

    +-----------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


The first eight registers, r0-r7, are used to pass argument values into a subroutine and to return result values from a function. They may also be used to hold intermediate values within a routine (but, in general, only between subroutine calls).

Registers r16 (IP0/CIP0) and r17 (IP1/CIP1) may be used by a linker as a scratch register between a routine and any subroutine it calls (for details, see `Use of CIP0 and CIP1 by the linker`_). They can also be used within a routine to hold intermediate values between subroutine calls.

The role of register r18 is platform specific. If a platform ABI has need of a dedicated general purpose register to carry inter-procedural state (for example, the thread context) then it should use this register for that purpose. If the platform ABI has no such requirements, then it should use r18 as an additional temporary register. The platform ABI specification must document the usage for this register.

In AAPCS64-cap a subroutine invocation must preserve the contents of the registers r19-r29 and CSP. All 128 bits and the tag bit of each value stored in r19-r29 must be preserved.

In AAPCS64 a subroutine invocation must preserve the contents of the lower 64 bits of registers r19-r29 and SP. There is no requirement to preserve the tag bit.

.. note::

    In AAPCS64 c19-c30 and CSP are not callee-saved, although x19-x30 and SP are callee-saved. It is therefore the responsibility of the caller to save any of the c19-c30 and CSP registers before any call, if these registers are used by the caller.

In all variants of the procedure call standard, registers r16, r17, r29 and r30 have special roles. In these roles they are labelled IP0, IP1, FP and LR when being used for holding addresses (that is, the special name implies accessing the register as a 64-bit entity).

.. note::

    The special register names (IP0/CIP0, IP1/CIP1, FP/CFP and LR/CLR) should be used only in the context in which they are special. It is recommended that disassemblers always use the architectural names for the registers.

Processes, Memory and the Stack
-------------------------------

The Stack in AAPCS64-cap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The stack is a contiguous area of memory that may be used for storage of local variables and, when there are insufficient argument registers available, for passing additional arguments to subroutines .

The stack implementation is full-descending, with the current extent of the stack held in the special-purpose register CSP. The stack will  have both a base and a limit, and an application can get these values by observing the base and limit of CSP.

The size of the stack is fixed in AAPCS64-cap. This size is encoded in CSP.

AAPCS64-cap has the same rules and constraints for maintenance of the stack as AAPCS64, with the following additional constraints:

- CSP must be a valid capability with the tag set, zero type (unsealed), and the bounds set to stack-base and stack-limit. In this case, stack-base and stack-limit are defined as being the bounds of the CSP capability. The values of stack-base and stack-limit are constrained such that they can form the upper and lower bound of a representable capability.

- CSP must have the Load, Store, LoadCap, StoreCap and MutableLoad permission bits set.

- CSP must have enough permission to be used to store capabilities derived from CSP. This means that CSP should either have at least one of the Global and StoreLocalCap permissions.


The Frame Pointer in AAPCS64-cap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Conforming code shall construct a linked list of stack-frames. Each
frame shall link to the frame of its caller by means of a frame record
of two capability values on the stack. The frame record for the
innermost frame (belonging to the most recent routine invocation) shall
be pointed to by the Capability Frame Pointer register (CFP).  The lowest
addressed capability shall point to the previous frame record and the
highest addressed capability shall contain the value passed in CLR on
entry to the current function. The end of the frame record chain is
indicated by the NULL capability in the address for the previous frame.
The location of the frame record within a stack frame is not specified.

.. note::
   There will always be a short period during construction or destruction of each frame record during which the frame pointer will point to the caller’s record.

A platform shall mandate the minimum level of conformance with respect to the maintenance of frame records, with the same choices as for AAPCS64.


Subroutine Calls
----------------

The A64 and C64 states contain primitive subroutine call instructions, BL and BLR, which performs a branch-with-link operation. The effect of executing BL is to transfer the sequentially next value of the program counter - the return address - into the link register (LR or CLR) and the destination address into the program counter.  The effect of executing BLR is similar except that the new PC value is constructed from the specified register.


Use of CIP0 and CIP1 by the linker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The A64 and C64 branch instructions are unable to reach every destination in the address space, so it may be necessary for the linker to insert a veneer between a calling routine and a called subroutine. Veneers may also be needed to support dynamic linking and interworking between A64 and C64. Any veneer inserted must preserve the contents of all registers except CIP0, CIP1 (r16, r17) and the condition code flags; a conforming program must assume that a veneer that alters CIP0 and/or CIP1 may be inserted at any branch instruction that is exposed to a relocation that supports long branches.


Parameter Passing
-----------------

The base standard provides for passing arguments in general-purpose registers (r0-r7), SIMD/floating-point registers (v0-v7) and on the stack. For subroutines that take a small number of small parameters, only registers are used.

Parameter Passing Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameter passing rules are modified from those shown in the AAPCS64_ document to take into account capabilities.
The marshalling of machine types is the same for AAPCS64 and AAPCS64-cap.

The differences in language bindings used for AAPCS64 and AAPCS64-cap are described in `Types Varying by Data Model and Procedure Calling Standard`_.

Result Return
-------------

The manner in which a result is returned from a function is determined by the type of that result:

- If the type, T, of the result of a function is such that

  ``void func(T arg)``

  would require that arg be passed as a value in a register (or set of registers) according to the rules in `Parameter Passing`_, then the result is returned in the same registers as would be used for such an argument.

- Otherwise, the caller shall reserve a block of memory of sufficient size and alignment to hold the result. The address of the memory block shall be passed as an additional argument to the function in x8 in AAPCS64 and c8 in AAPCS64-cap. The callee may modify the result memory block at any point during the execution of the subroutine (there is no requirement for the callee to preserve the value stored in r8).


Interworking
------------

Interworking between the 32-bit AAPCS and the AAPCS64 or AAPCS64-cap is not supported within a single process. (In AArch64, all inter-operation between 32-bit and 64-bit machine states takes place across a change of exception level).

Interworking between data model variants of AAPCS64 (although technically possible) is not defined within a single process.

Interworking between AAPCS64 and AAPCS64-cap is not supported.

Interworking between A64 and C64 states is supported. The linker will insert a veneer at direct branches between different states. The veneer will perform both the state switch and range extensions. It is the responsibility of the callee to switch state on return.

Arm C AND C++ Language Mappings
===============================

This section describes how Arm compilers map C language features onto the machine-level standard. To the extent that C++ is a superset of the C language it also describes the mapping of C++ language features.

Data Types
----------

Types Varying by Data Model and Procedure Calling Standard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AAPCS64-cap uses different language mappings for any C/C++ Type that would be a code or data pointer in AAPCS64, while keeping
other data types the same.

These differences, and new Morello-specific data types are shown in `C/C++ type variants by data model and PCS`_.

APPENDIX Variable argument Lists
================================
Languages such as C and C++ permit routines that take a variable number of arguments (that is, the number of parameters is controlled by the caller rather than the callee). Furthermore, they may then pass some or even all of these parameters as a block to further subroutines to process the list. If a routine shares any of its optional arguments with other routines then a parameter control block needs to be created. The remainder of this appendix is informative.


Register Save Areas
-------------------

The prologue of a function which accepts a variable argument list and which invokes the ``va_start`` macro is expected to save the incoming argument registers to three register save areas within its own stack frame: one area to hold the 64-bit general registers xn-x7, a second area to hold the 128-bit FP/SIMD registers vn-v7 and a third area to hold the capability registers cn-c7. Only parameter registers beyond those which hold the named parameters need be saved, and if a function is known never to accept parameters in registers of that class, then that register save area may be omitted altogether. In the first two areas the registers are saved in ascending order. The memory format of FP/SIMD registers save area must be as if each register were saved using the integer str instruction for the entire (ie Q) register.


The third register save area is located immediately above the general-purpose register area. The start of this area must be 16-byte aligned. It will contain the values of the capability registers cn-c7, stored starting at the address ``__gr_top`` from the highest numbered register to the lowest number register. All registers saved in this area must have their corresponding x sub-register stored in the general-purpose register save area as well. The capability register save area can be omitted if no capability arguments are used.

The va_list type
----------------

The ``va_list`` type may refer to any parameter in a parameter list, which depending on its type and position in the argument list may be in one of three memory locations: the current function’s general register argument save area, its FP/SIMD register argument save area, or the calling function’s outgoing stack argument area.

.. code-block:: c

    typedef struct  va_list {
        void * stack; // next stack param
        void * gr_top; // end of GP arg reg save area
        void * vr_top; // end of FP/SIMD arg reg save area
        int gr_offs; // offset from  gr_top to next GP register arg
        int vr_offs; // offset from  vr_top to next FP/SIMD register arg
    } va_list;

In AAPCS64-cap the stack, ``gr_top`` and ``vr_top`` fields of ``va_list`` are capabilities, while in the AAPCS64 they are pointers.

The va_start() macro
--------------------

The ``va_start`` macro shall initialize the fields of its ``va_list`` argument as follows, where ``named_gr`` represents the number of general registers known to hold named incoming arguments and ``named_vr`` the number of FP/SIMD registers known to hold named incoming arguments.

- ``__stack``: set to the address following the last (highest addressed) named incoming argument on the stack, rounded upwards to a multiple of 8 bytes, or if there are no named arguments on the stack, then the value of the stack pointer when the function was entered.

- ``__gr_top``: set to the address of the byte immediately following the general register argument save area, the end of the save area being aligned to a 16 byte boundary.

- ``__vr_top``: set to the address of the byte immediately following the FP/SIMD register argument save area, the end of the save area being aligned to a 16 byte boundary.

- ``__gr_offs``: set to ``0 – ((8 – named_gr) * 8)``.

- ``__vr_offs``: set to ``0 – ((8 – named_vr) * 16)``.

If it is known that a ``va_list`` structure is never used to access arguments that could be passed in the FP/SIMD argument registers, then no FP/SIMD argument registers need to be saved, and the ``__vr_top`` and ``__vr_offs`` fields initialised to the NULL capability and zero respectively. Furthermore, if in this case the general register argument save area is located immediately below the value of the stack pointer on entry, then the ``__stack`` field may be set to the address of the anonymous argument in the general register argument save area and the ``__gr_top`` and ``__gr_offs`` fields also
set to the NULL capability and zero, permitting a simplified implementation of ``va_arg`` which simply advances the ``__stack`` pointer through the argument save area and into the incoming stacked arguments. This simplification may not be used in the reverse case where anonymous arguments are known to be in FP/SIMD registers but not in general registers.

The va_arg() macro
------------------

The algorithm to implement the generic ``va_arg(ap,type)`` macro is then most easily described using a C-like "pseudocode", as follows:

.. code-block:: c

    type va_arg (va_list ap, type)
    {
        int nreg, offs;
        if (type passed in general registers) {
            offs = ap.__gr_offs;
            if (offs >= 0)
                goto on_stack;              // reg save area empty
            if (!containsCapabilities(type)) {
              if (alignof(type) > 8)
                  offs = (offs + 15) & -16;   // round up
              nreg = (sizeof(type) + 7) / 8;
              ap.__gr_offs = offs + (nreg * 8);
            } else {
              offs = (offs + 7) & -8;// round up
              nreg = sizeof(type) / sizeof(void * __capability);
              ap.__gr_offs = offs + (nreg * 8);
            }
            if (ap.__gr_offs > 0)
                goto on_stack;              // overflowed reg save area
    #ifdef BIG_ENDIAN
            if (classof(type) != "aggregate" && sizeof(type) < 8)
                offs += 8 - sizeof(type);
    #endif
            if (containsCapabilities(type)) {
              // Types containing capabilities are passed in capability
              // registers. Capability registers are stored in reverse
              // order.
              type T;
              for (unsigned reg = 0; reg < nreg; ++reg) {
                index = (reg + 1) * 16;
                ((void *__capability *)&T)[reg] =
                    *(void *__capability)(ap.__gr_top - 2 * offs - index;
              }
              return T;
            }
            return *(type *)(ap.__gr_top + offs);
        } else if (type is an HFA or an HVA) {
            type ha;       // treat as "struct {ftype field[n];}"
            offs = ap.__vr_offs;
            if (offs >= 0)
                goto on_stack;              // reg save area empty

                ha.field[i] = *((ftype *)(ap.__vr_top + offs));
            return ha;
        } else if (type passed in fp/simd registers) {
            offs = ap.__vr_offs;
            if (offs >= 0)
                goto on_stack;              // reg save area empty
            nreg = (sizeof(type) + 15) / 16;
