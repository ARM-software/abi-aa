Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
license (both the Public License and this Patent License), each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material
to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You
under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

About the license
-----------------

As identified more fully in the Licence_ section, this project
is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 along with an additional patent
license.  The language in the additional patent license is largely
identical to that in Apache-2.0 (specifically, Section 3 of Apache-2.0
as reflected at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with two
exceptions.

First, several changes were made related to the defined terms so as to
reflect the fact that such defined terms need to align with the
terminology in CC-BY-SA-4.0 rather than Apache-2.0 (e.g., changing
“Work” to “Licensed Material”).

Second, the defensive termination clause was changed such that the
scope of defensive termination applies to “any licenses granted to
You” (rather than “any patent licenses granted to You”).  This change
is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing
additional protection to the community against patent litigation
claims.

Contributions
-------------

Contributions to this project are licensed under an inbound=outbound
model such that any such contributions are licensed by the contributor
under the same terms as those in the `Licence`_ section.

About this document
===================

Change control
--------------

Current status and anticipated changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.

This document is a draft and all content is at the **Alpha** quality level.
The relocation codes in `Relocation`_ in particular are expected to change.

Change history
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is no entry in the change history table for a release, there are no
changes to the content of the document for that release.

About This Specification
========================

This specification only provides the Morello-specific extensions to the base ELF
specification for the Arm 64-bit Architecture (AArch64), and is expected to be
used along with AAELF64_.

`Object Files`_ is structured to correspond to the chapter with
the same name in `AAELF64`_:

Object Files
============

ELF Header
----------

The ELF header provides a number of fields that assist in interpretation of the
file. Most of these are specified in the base standard. The following fields
have Morello-specific meanings.

``e_flags``
  The processor-specific flags are shown in the following table.

.. _Morello-specific e_flags:

  +-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | :code:`EF_AARCH64_CHERI_PURECAP`  | The ELF file uses an ABI where all pointers are implemented  |
  | (:code:`0x00010000`)              | using capabilities (Pure-capability ABI).                    |
  +-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Sections
--------

Special Sections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Morello toolchain can emit ELF Note sections in accordance to [CHERI_ELF_].

Symbol Table
------------

Symbol Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

All code symbols exported from an object file (symbols with binding
``STB_GLOBAL``) shall have type ``STT_FUNC``. All extern data objects shall have
type ``STT_OBJECT``. No ``STB_GLOBAL`` data symbol shall have type ``STT_FUNC``.
The type of an undefined symbol shall be ``STT_NOTYPE`` or the type of its
expected definition.

The type of any other symbol defined in an executable section can be
``STT_NOTYPE``. A linker is only required to provide long-branch and PLT support
for symbols of type ``STT_FUNC``. A linker is also only required to provide
interworking support for A64 and C64 symbols of type ``STT_FUNC`` (interworking
for untyped symbols must be encoded directly in the object file)

Symbol names
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A symbol that names a C or assembly language entity should have the name of that
entity. For example, a C function called ``calculate`` generates a symbol called
``calculate`` (not ``_calculate``).

Symbol names are case sensitive and are matched exactly by linkers.

Any symbol with binding ``STB_LOCAL`` may be removed from an object and replaced
with an offset from another symbol in the same section under the following
conditions:

- The original symbol and replacement symbol are not of type ``STT_FUNC``, or
  both symbols are of type ``STT_FUNC`` and describe code of the same
  instruction set state (either both A64 or both C64).

- The symbol is not described by the debug information.

- The symbol is not a mapping symbol (`Mapping symbols`_).

- The resulting object, or image, is not required to preserve accurate symbol
  information to permit de-compilation or other post-linking optimization
  techniques.

- If the symbol labels an object in a section with the ``SHF_MERGE`` flag set,
  the relocation using symbol may be changed to use the section symbol only if
  the initial addend of the relocation is zero.

No tool is required to perform the above transformations; an object consumer
must be prepared to do this itself if it might find the additional symbols
confusing.

Mapping symbols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A section of an ELF file can contain a mixture of A64 code, C64 code and data.
There are inline transitions between code and data at literal pool boundaries.

Linkers, file decoders and other tools need to map binaries correctly. To
support this, a number of symbols, termed mapping symbols, appear in the symbol
table to label the start of each sequence of bytes of the appropriate class. All
mapping symbols have type ``STT_NOTYPE`` and binding ``STB_LOCAL``. The
``st_size`` field is unused and must be zero.

The mapping symbols are defined in `Mapping symbols table`_. It is an error for
a relocation to reference a mapping symbol. Two forms of mapping symbol are
supported:

- A short form that uses a dollar character and a single letter denoting the
  class. This form can be used when an object producer creates mapping symbols
  automatically. Its use minimizes string table size.

- A longer form in which the short form is extended with a period, followed by
  any sequence of characters that are legal for a symbol. This form can be used
  when assembler files have to be annotated manually and the assembler does not
  support multiple definitions of symbols.

Mapping symbols defined in a section (relocatable view) or segment (executable
view) define a sequence of half-open intervals that cover the address range of
the section or segment. Each interval starts at the address defined by the
mapping symbol, and continues up to, but not including, the address defined by
the next (in address order) mapping symbol or the end of the section or segment.
A section that contains instructions must have a mapping symbol defined at the
beginning of the section. If a section contains only data, no mapping symbol is
required. A platform ABI should specify whether or not mapping symbols are
present in the executable view; they will never  be present in a stripped
executable file.

    +----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

Symbol Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to the normal rules for symbol values, the following rules shall also
apply to symbols of type ``STT_FUNC`` and ``STT_GNU_IFUNC``:

- If the symbol addresses an A64 instruction, its value is the address of the
  instruction (in a relocatable object, the offset of the instruction from the
  start of the section containing it).

- If the symbol addresses a C64 instruction, its value is the address of the
  instruction with bit 0 set (in a relocatable object, the section offset with
  bit 0 set).

.. note::
  This allows a linker to distinguish A64 and C64 code symbols without having
  to refer to the map. An A64 symbol will always have an even value, while a
  C64 symbol will always have an odd value. However, a linker should strip the
  discriminating bit from the value before using it for relocation.

Relocation
----------

Relocation types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Relocation codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Morello uses the private relocation code space for vendor experiments [0xE000,
0xF000) specified in AAELF64_.

Static Morello relocation codes begin at 0xE000(57344); dynamic ones at
0xE800(59392). Relocation codes starting at 0xEA00(59904) are reserved for
private Morello experiments.

Relocation operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following nomenclature is used in the descriptions of relocation operations:

- ``S`` (when used on its own) is the address of the symbol.

- ``A`` is the addend for the relocation.

- ``P`` is the address of the place being relocated (derived from ``r_offset``).

- ``C`` is 1 if the target symbol ``S`` has type ``STT_FUNC`` and the symbol
  addresses a C64 instruction; it is 0 otherwise.

- ``X`` is the result of a relocation operation, before any masking or
  bit-selection operation is applied

- ``Page(expr)`` is the page address of the expression expr, defined as (``expr &
  ~0xFFF``). This applies even if the machine page size supported by the platform
  has a different value.

- ``GOT`` is the address of the Global Offset Table, the table of code and data
  addresses to be resolved at dynamic link time. The ``GOT`` and each entry in it
  must be aligned to the pointer-size.

- ``GDAT(S+A)`` represents a pointer-sized entry in the ``GOT`` for address
  ``S+A``. The entry will be relocated at run time with relocation
  ``R_MORELLO_GLOB_DAT(S+A)``.

- ``G(expr)`` is the address of the GOT entry for the expression expr.

- ``GTLSDESC(S+A)`` represents a consecutive pair of pointer-sized entries in
  the GOT which contain a ``tlsdesc`` structure describing the thread-local
  variable located at offset ``A`` from thread-local symbol ``S``. The first
  entry holds a pointer to the variable's TLS descriptor resolver function and
  the second entry holds a platform-specific offset or pointer. The pair of
  pointer-sized entries will be relocated with ``R_MORELLO_TLSDESC(S+A)``.

- ``Delta(S)`` if ``S`` is a normal symbol, resolves to the difference between the
  static link address of ``S`` and the execution address of ``S``. If ``S`` is the
  null symbol (ELF symbol index 0), resolves to the difference between the static
  link address of ``P`` and the execution address of ``P``.

- ``TPREL(S)`` resolves to a pair of two 64-bit values. The first value
  contains the offset in the static TLS block of the thread-local symbol ``S``.
  The second value contains the size of the symbol ``S``

- ``GTPREL(S)`` represents an entry in the GOT containing a pair of two 64-bit
  values. The first value contains the offset in the static TLS block of the
  symbol ``S``. The second value contains the size of the symbol ``S``.

- ``TLSDESC(S+A)`` resolves to a contiguous pair of pointer-sized values, as
  created by GTLSDESC(S+A).

- ``CAP_INIT`` generates a capability with all required information. When used on
  its own represents the operations needs to be done for handling ``R_MORELLO_CAPINIT``.

- ``CAP_SIZE`` is the size of the underlying memory region that the capability can
  reference. This may not directly map to the symbol size.

- ``SIZE(S)`` is the symbol size of the symbol ``S``.

- ``CAP_PERM`` is the permission of the capability. This may not directly map to
  the type of the symbol.

- ``[msb:lsb]`` is a bit-mask operation representing the selection of bits in a
  value. The bits selected range from ``lsb`` up to ``msb`` inclusive. For
  example, ‘bits [3:0]’ represents the bits under the mask 0x0000000F. When
  range checking is applied to a value, it is applied before the masking
  operation is performed.

.. topic:: pointer-size

  The pointer-size is 64 bits for the A64 ABI and 128 bits for the pure capability (C64)
  ABI.

Call and Jump relocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is one relocation code (``R_MORELLO_CALL26``) for function call (``BL``)
instructions and one (``R_MORELLO_JUMP26``) for jump (``B``) instructions.

A linker may use a veneer (a sequence of instructions) to implement a relocated
branch if the relocation is either

``R_MORELLO_CALL26`` or ``R_MORELLO_JUMP26`` and:

- The target symbol has type ``STT_FUNC``.
- Or, the target symbol and relocated place are in separate sections input to the linker.
- Or, the target symbol is undefined (external to the link unit).

In all other cases a linker shall diagnose an error if a relocation cannot be
effected without a veneer. A linker generated veneer may corrupt register
``c16`` and the condition flags, but must preserve all other registers. Linker
veneers may be needed for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:

- Interworking: The branch source and target symbol are in different execution states(A64/C64).
- Range Extension: The branch source and target symbol are in C64 execution state and the target
  is outside the addressable span of the branch instruction (+/- 128MB).
- The target address will not be known until run time, or the target address might be pre-empted.

Long branches with 64-bit range are not supported yet for range extensions or for interworking.
Interworking between ABIs are not supported yet.

Relocations for thread-local storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Morello only defines the relocations needed to implement the descriptor based
thread-local storage (TLS) models in a SysV-type environment. The details of
TLS descriptors are beyond the scope of this specification; a general
introduction can be found in [TLSDESC_]. Also, only the relocations needed to
implement the General Dynamic (GD) access model and the Local Executable (LE)
access models are defined.

Relocations needed to define the traditional TLS models are undefined.

.. note::

  ``R_MORELLO_CAPINIT`` instructs the runtime or dynamic loader to create a 16-byte
  capability at ``r_offset``. ``r_offset`` must be 16-byte aligned. An object
  producer may communicate a hint about the size of the capability to the static
  linker in the 16-byte fragment identified by ``r_offset``. The fragment has
  the following format:

  ``| 64-bits empty | 64-bits size |``

  ``R_MORELLO_GLOB_DAT`` instructs the runtime or dynamic loader to create a 16-byte
  capability in the GOT entry identified by ``r_offset``. The capability holds the
  address of a data symbol which must be resolved at load time when dynamic
  linking.

  ``R_MORELLO_JUMP_SLOT`` instructs the dynamic loader to derive a 16-byte
  capability in the GOT entry identified by ``r_offset``. Information needed to
  derive the capability is encoded in the fragment identified by ``r_offset``.
  The address and permissions must be written to the fragment. See `Dynamic
  linking with Morello`_ for details.

  ``R_MORELLO_RELATIVE`` represents an optimization of ``R_MORELLO_GLOB_DAT``. It can be
  used when the symbol resolves to the current shared object or executable. ``S``
  must be the ``Null`` symbol (Index 0). The address and permissions must be written
  to the fragment. See `Dynamic linking with Morello`_ for details.

  ``R_MORELLO_IRELATIVE`` is used by the linker when transforming ``IFUNC`` s. The
  rest are the same as ``R_MORELLO_RELATIVE``

  ``R_MORELLO_TLSDESC`` : identifies a TLS descriptor to be filled by the dynamic loader.
  If the size of ``S`` is known by the static linker the 256-bit fragment will contain the size
  of the symbol in the last 64 bits of the fragment. Otherwise the fragment will contain
  all zeroes. The fragment has the following format:

  ``| 192-bits empty | 64-bits size |``

  ``R_MORELLO_TPREL128`` : instructs the dynamic loader to create a pair of two
  64-bit integers, the first integer containing the offset of ``S`` in the TLS
  block and the second integer containing the size of the symbol ``S``. The first
  64-bit integer (the offset) has the same fragment encoding as ``R_AARCH64_TLS_TPREL``.
  If the size of ``S`` is known by the static linker the second 64-bit integer in the
  fragment will contain the size of the symbol. The fragment has the following format:

  ``| 64-bits offset | 64-bits size |``

  ``R_MORELLO_CODE_CAPINIT`` is similar to ``R_MORELLO_CAPINIT`` but signifies
  that the capability being relocated is a code pointer as opposed to a data
  pointer or function pointer. As such, it must only be used against
  ``STT_FUNC`` symbols. This relocation type is needed for library-based
  compartmentalization (c18n). Currently for security reasons this relocation
  may only be used against non-preemptible symbols, and thus will be converted
  to ``R_MORELLO_RELATIVE`` at link time, making it in effect a static
  relocation. However, this restriction may be removed in future if needed, and
  it is therefore classed as a dynamic relocation.

  ``R_MORELLO_FUNC_RELATIVE`` and ``R_AARCH64_FUNC_RELATIVE`` : similar to
  their non-``_FUNC`` counterparts but signify that the capability being
  relocated is a function pointer as opposed to a data pointer or code pointer.
  This distinction is needed for library-based compartmentalization (c18n).

Static linking with Morello
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A capability has more associated information than a conventional pointer. It has
extra information. For example: base, offset, size and permissions.

Capabilities cannot be statically initialised. Global capability initialization
when static linking is performed by the runtime at program startup. The
communication between the static linker and runtime is implementation defined.
This document describes an implementation based on a table of capability
descriptions created at static link time, where each capability-generating
relocation results in one entry in the table. When static linking,
all capability descriptions will be explicitly grouped into a single table of
capability descriptions where each table entry is a ``struct capdesc`` (listed
below).

In the current LLVM based Morello toolchain, the runtime iterates through each
``capdesc`` entry creating a capability in the location pointed to by
cap_location, with the specified base, offset, size and permissions given by the
entry. To aid in the finding of the capability descriptions table, the linker
emits two symbols to denote the start and end of the table:
``__cap_relocs_start`` and ``__cap_relocs_end`` respectively. The capability
descriptions table is placed inside the ``__cap_relocs`` section.

.. code-block:: c

    struct capdesc
    {
        void*__capability cap_location;
        void* base;
        uint64_t offset;
        uint64_t size;
        uint64_t permissions;
    };

The permission bits of a capability constructed for a ``capdesc`` entry is the
inverse of the ``permissions[17:0]`` field in the ``capdesc`` entry.
Additionally, the MSB (bit 64) of the ``capdesc`` ``permissions`` field is set
for Executable symbols to indicate that the PCC is to be used to construct the
Capability.

+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Permission        | Encoding                        |
+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Executable        | ``0x8000000000013DBCULL``       |
+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Read-Write Data   | ``0x8FBEULL``                   |
+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Read-Only Data    | ``0x1BFBEULL``                  |
+-------------------+---------------------------------+

When a Morello-capable assembler sees a ``.capinit`` instruction, it reserves a
16-byte (128 bits) location (``fragment``) and  generates a
``R_MORELLO_CAPINIT`` relocation for the linker to create a capability in the
``fragment``. The assembler may use the ``fragment`` with the following format
to give out size hints for the linker to use before processing the relocation:

+----------------+--------------+
|  64-bit: empty | 64-bit: size |
+----------------+--------------+

This size hint will be incorporated into the ``capdesc`` ``size`` field, if not
superseded by more accurate information.

In case of position independent code (PIC), the assembler will generate a
``R_MORELLO_LD128_GOT_LO12_NC`` relocation, which causes the linker to generate
a 16-byte aligned, 16-byte sized entry in the ``.got`` that will be initialised
by a ``capdesc`` entry in a capability descriptions table with the address of
the ``.got`` entry as its ``location`` field. All information required to
initialize the capability is self-contained in the ``capdesc`` entry, so the
linker is not required to provide any size hints in the ``.got`` entry.

Dynamic linking with Morello
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When dynamic linking, capability initialization is done by the dynamic linker as
a result of processing one of the dynamic relocations listed in
`Dynamic relocations table`_. For ``R_MORELLO_JUMP_SLOT``, ``R_MORELLO_RELATIVE``
and ``R_MORELLO_IRELATIVE`` relocations, the static linker must write the following
information to the fragment identified by ``r_offset``.

+------------------+-----------------+----------------------+
|  64-bit: address | 56-bits: length |  8-bits: permissions |
+------------------+-----------------+----------------------+

The 8-bit permission field of the fragment encodes the symbol permissions as
below.

+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Permission        | Encoding                        |
+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Executable        | ``0x4ULL``                      |
+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Read-Write Data   | ``0x2ULL``                      |
+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Read-Only Data    | ``0x1ULL``                      |
+-------------------+---------------------------------+

As in `Static linking with Morello`_, the linker creates a 16-byte aligned,
16-byte sized entry in the ``.got`` for the ``R_MORELLO_LD128_GOT_LO12_NC``
relocation generated by the assembler. However, a capability descriptions table
is not generated to initialize the ``.got`` entry. Instead it is expected that
the dynamic linker generates the table itself based on the ``R_MORELLO_GLOB_DAT`` and
``R_MORELLO_JUMP_SLOT`` relocations created by the static linker. The dynamic linker
writes the generated capabilities back into the ``.got`` entry.

APPENDIX
========
The status of this appendix is ``informative``.

Sample initialization of capabilities at runtime
------------------------------------------------
The following code is sample runtime initialization code that initializes
global capabilities created by an LLVM-based Morello toolchain.

.. code-block:: text

  __init_global_caps:
      mrs     c2, DDC    /* Default data capability */
      adrp    c0, __cap_relocs_start
      add     c0, c0, #:lo12:__cap_relocs_start
      adrp    c1, __cap_relocs_end
      add     c1, c1, #:lo12:__cap_relocs_end
      gcvalue x1, c1
      gcvalue x0, c0
      cmp     x0, x1
      b.eq    .CapInitEnd
      sub     x5, x1, x0     /* __cap_relocs_size */
      scvalue  c0, c2, x0
      scvalue  c1, c2, x1
      /* Clear permissions that we're not going to want on global capabilities. */
      ldr x5, =(BIT_07  |  \ /* Compartment ID */
                BIT_08  |  \ /* Branch Unseal */
                BIT_10  |  \ /* Unseal */
                BIT_11 )     /* Seal */
      clrperm c2, c2, x5
  .CapInit:
      ldr     x5,  [c0], #8    /* Capability location */
      ldr     x24, [c0], #8    /* Object refered by the capability */
      cbnz    c24, .CapNonNull
      add     c0, c0, #24
      mov     x4, #0          /* c4 <- nullptr */
      b       .CapCont
  .CapNonNull:
      ldr     x25, [c0], #8    /* Offset in the object */
      ldr     x26, [c0], #8    /* Size */
      ldr     x9, [c0], #8     /* Permissions */
      /* Set the executive permission for executable capabilities */
      scvalue c4, c2, x24      /* Set capability base */
      scbndse c4, c4, x26      /* Set size */
      scoff   c4, c4, x25      /* Add offset */
      clrperm c4, c4, x9       /* Clear permission bits set in __cap_desc_ */
  .CapCont:
      scvalue c5, c2, x5
      str     c4, [c5]
      cmp     c0, c1
      b.ne    .CapInit
  .CapInitEnd:
      ret

Sample linker generated veneers
-------------------------------
For C64 to A64 interworking, the following veneer is used:

.. code-block:: text

  adrp c16, sym
  add c16, c16, :lo12:sym
  br c16

For A64 to C64 interworking, and for C64 to C64 Range Extension, the following
veneer is used. The BX changes the execution state from A64 to C64:

.. code-block:: text

  bx #4
  adrp c16, sym
  add c16, c16, :lo12:sym
  br c16

TLS for the pure capability ABI
-------------------------------

The design is based on TLSDESC, with the purpose of minimizing the performance
differences between A64 and C64, while providing strict bounds when resolving
TLS globals.

TLS static block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The static block layout is the same used in AArch64 (Variant 1, see [TLS_]), with
the only exception that TCB and the DTV pointer are capabilities.

Thread pointer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The thread pointer is a capability, held in ``CTPIDR_EL0``. The thread pointer
needs to have the read, write, read capability and write capability permissions
and bounds such that the entire TLS static block is accessible.

Resolver functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A resolver function takes arguments in c0 (address of the TLS GOT slot), and c2
(a copy of the thread pointer) and returns a pointer to the TLS global in c0.
The resolver function has a custom calling convention that must preserve all
registers except c0 and c1.

Considerations:

- Any dynamically loaded modules will be placed outside of the bounds of the
  thread pointer, so a resolver function cannot return an offset from the
  thread pointer, but rather needs to return a pointer (capability).
- To minimize reading of ``CTPIDR_EL0``, the resolver functions take a
  copy of ``CTPIDR_EL0`` as an argument and preserve it.


Static TLS block resolver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the TLS variable is in the static block, while resolving the
``R_MORELLO_TLSDESC`` relocation, the dynamic linker will place in the two GOT
slots associated with this variable:

- A capability to the static TLS block resolver function at offset 0.

- The offset of the variable in the static TLS block at offset 16 (8 bytes).

- The size of the variable at offset 24 (8 bytes).

An implementation of the static block resolver could be the following:

.. code-block:: text

  ldp x0, x1, [c0, #16]
  add c0, c2, x0
  scbnds c0, c0, x1
  ret c30

Local Exec
^^^^^^^^^^

The capability to the TLS variable is derived from ``CTPIDR_EL0``. There
are no requirements on how this is performed or the registers used, except
that the sequence doesn't produce a dynamic relocation. A possible
instruction sequence could be:

.. code-block:: text

  mrs c0, CTPIDR_EL0
  movz x8, #:tprel_g1:local_exec_var
  movk x8, #:tprel_g0_nc:local_exec_var
  movz x9, #:size_g1:local_exec_var
  movk x9, #:size_g0_nc:local_exec_var
  add c0, c0, x8, uxtx
  scbnds c0, c0, x9

Initial Exec
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The capability to the TLS variable is derived from ``CTPIDR_EL0``. The size
and offset of the TLS variable is stored in a GOT slot (first 8 bytes contains the
offset and the second 8 bytes the size). This GOT slot is initialized by a
``R_MORELLO_TPREL128`` dynamic relocation. The access must use the
``R_MORELLO_TLSIE_ADR_GOTTPREL_PAGE20`` and ``R_MORELLO_TLSIE_ADD_LO12``
relocations in order to allow relaxation to Local Exec. There are no other
requirements on how this is performed or the registers used. A possible
instruction sequence could be:

.. code-block:: text

  adrp c0, :gottprel:initial_exec_var
  add c0, c0, :gottprel_lo12:initial_exec_var
  ldp x0, x8, [c0]
  mrs c1, CTPIDR_EL0
  add c0, c1, x0, uxtx
  scbnds c0, c0, x8

Initial Exec to Local Exec relaxation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The linker will generate 16 bytes in a read-only section, containing
the offset in the static TLS block in the first 8 bytes and the size of the
symbol in the next 8 bytes:

.. code-block:: text

  .section .rodata
  _sym_data:
    .xword tlsoffset(sym)
    .xword sizeof(sym)

.. note::

  ``tlsoffset(sym)`` denotes the offset in the static TLS block of the symbol
  ``sym``, while sizeof(sym) denotes the size of the symbol ``sym``. These are
  not valid assembler directives.

The relaxation is performed by:

- changing the ``R_MORELLO_TLSIE_ADR_GOTTPREL_PAGE20`` relocation on the symbol
  ``sym`` to a ``R_MORELLO_ADR_PREL_PG_HI20`` with the symbol ``_sym_data``

- changing the ``R_MORELLO_TLSIE_ADD_LO12`` relocation on symbol the ``sym`` to
  a ``R_AARCH64_ADD_ABS_LO12_NC`` relocation with the symbol ``_sym_data``.

.. note::

  The symbol and section names in the example above are only used for explanation
  purposes. An implementation does not need to create an additional symbol when
  performing this relaxation. There is no constraint on the name of the read-only
  section where the data is placed.

General Dynamic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The instruction sequence used for the General Dynamic access model is similar to
that of other TLSDESC implementations, with the exception that the result
doesn't need to be added to the thread pointer. However c2 needs to contain
the thread pointer. The instruction sequence contains an additional NOP
instruction in order to permit the static linker to perform a relaxation to Local
Exec or Initial Exec.

The General Dynamic access sequence must be output in the following form to
allow correct linker relaxation:

.. code-block:: text

  adrp c0, :tlsdesc:sym
  ldr c1, [c0, :tlsdesc_lo12:sym]
  add c0, c0, :tlsdesc_lo12:sym
  nop
  .tlsdesccall sym
  blr c1

General Dynamic to Initial Exec relaxation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The relaxed sequence is:

.. code-block:: text

  adrp c0, :gottprel:sym
  add c0, c0, :gottprel_lo12:sym
  ldp x0, x1, [c0]
  add c0, c2, x0
  scbnds c0, c0, x1


General Dynamic to Local Exec relaxation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The linker will generate 16 bytes in a read-only section, containing
the offset in the static TLS block in the first 8 bytes and the size of the
symbol in the next 8 bytes:

.. code-block:: text

  .section .rodata
  _sym_data:
    .xword tlsoffset(sym)
    .xword sizeof(sym)

.. note::

  ``tlsoffset(sym)`` denotes the offset in the static TLS block of the symbol
  ``sym``, while sizeof(sym) denotes the size of the symbol ``sym``. These are
  not valid assembler directives.

The relaxed sequence is:

.. code-block:: text

  adrp c0, _sym_data
  add c0, c0, :lo12:_sym_data
  ldp x0, x1, [c0]
  add c0, c2, x0
  scbnds c0, c0, x1
