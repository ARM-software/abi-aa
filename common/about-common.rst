The following support level definitions are used by the Arm ABI specifications:

**Release**
   Arm considers this specification to have enough implementations, which have
   received sufficient testing, to verify that it is correct. The details of these
   criteria are dependent on the scale and complexity of the change over previous
   versions: small, simple changes might only require one implementation, but more
   complex changes require multiple independent implementations, which have been
   rigorously tested for cross-compatibility. Arm anticipates that future changes
   to this specification will be limited to typographical corrections,
   clarifications and compatible extensions.

**Beta**
   Arm considers this specification to be complete, but existing
   implementations do not meet the requirements for confidence in its release
   quality. Arm may need to make incompatible changes if issues emerge from its
   implementation.

**Alpha**
   The content of this specification is a draft, and Arm considers the
   likelihood of future incompatible changes to be significant.
